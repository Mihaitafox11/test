model and highlights the differences between the core (previously Diem) Move language and the Move used in Sui. To learn more about the motivations behind creating Sui Move, see Why We Created Sui Move. In general, Move code written for other systems will work in Sui with these exceptions: Global Storage operators Key Abilities Here is a summary of key differences: Sui uses its own object-centric global storage Addresses represent Object IDs Sui objects have globally unique IDs Sui has module initializers (init) Sui entry points take object references as input Find a detailed description of each change below. Object-centric global storage In core Move, global storage is part of the programming model and can be accessed through special operations, such as move_to, move_from and many more global storage operators. Both resources and modules are stored in the core Move global storage. When you publish a module, it’s stored into a newly generated module address inside Move. When a new object (a.k.a. resource) is created, it's usually stored into some address, as well. But on-chain storage is expensive and limited (not optimized for storage and indexing). Current blockchains cannot scale to handle storage-heavy applications such as marketplaces and social apps. So there is no global storage in Sui Move. None of the global storage-related operations are allowed in Sui Move. (We have a bytecode verifier for this to detect violations.) Instead, storage happens exclusively within Sui. When we publish a module, the newly published module is stored in Sui storage, instead of Move storage. Similarly, newly created objects are stored in Sui storage. This also means that when we need to read an object in Move, we cannot rely on global storage operations but instead Sui must explicitly pass all objects that need to be accessed into Move. Addresses represent Object IDs In Move, there is a special address type. This type is used to represent addresses in core Move. Core Move needs to know the address of an account when dealing with the global storage. The address type is 16 bytes, which is sufficient for the core Move security model. In Sui, since we don’t support global storage in Move, we don’t need the address type to represent user accounts. Instead, we use the address type to represent the Object ID. Refer to the object.move file in Sui framework for an understanding of address use. Object with key ability, globally unique IDs We need a way to distinguish between objects that are internal to Sui Move and objects that can be stored in Sui storage. This is important because we need to be able to serialize/deserialize objects in the Move-Sui boundary, and this process makes assumptions on the shape of the objects. We take advantage of the key ability in Move to annotate a Sui object. In core Move, the key ability is used to tell that the type can be used as a key for global storage. Since we don’t touch global storage in Sui Move, we are able to repurpose this ability. We require that any struct with key ability must start with an id field with the ID type. The ID type contains both the ObjectID and the sequence number (a.k.a. version). We have bytecode verifiers in place to make sure that the ID field is immutable and cannot be transferred to other objects (as each object must have a unique ID). Module initializers As described in Object-centric global storage, Sui Move modules are published into Sui storage. A special initializer function optionally defined in a module is executed (once) at the time of module publication by the Sui runtime for the purpose of pre-initializing module-specific data (e.g., creating singleton objects). The initializer function must have the following properties in order to be executed at publication: Name init Single parameter of &mut\sTxContext type No return values Private Entry points take object references as input Sui offers entry functions that can be called directly from Sui, in addition to functions callable from other functions. See Entry functions. Conclusion In summary, Sui takes advantage of Move’s security and flexibility and enhances it with the features described above to vastly improve throughput, reduce delays in finality, and make Sui Move programming easier. Now see how Sui works. For full details, see the Sui Smart Contracts Platform white paper. Why Move?

TransactionBlockBytesunsafe_transferSui signer sui_object_id gas_budget recipient amount TransactionBlockBytes Sui Sponsored Transactions A Sui Sponsored transaction is one where a Sui address (the sponsor’s) pays the gas fees for a transaction initialized by another address (the user’s). You can use Sponsored transactions to cover the fees for users on your site or app so that they do not get charged for them. This removes a significant obstacle that web2 users encounter when entering web3, as they often have to purchase tokens to perform a transaction on chain. For example, you could increase conversion rates for gamers by sponsoring their early transactions. Sponsored transactions also facilitate asset management as you don’t need to maintain multiple accounts with SUI tokens to transfer funds. You can use Sui Sponsored transactions to: Sponsor (pay gas fees for) a transaction initiated by a user. Sponsor transactions you initiate as the sponsor. Provide a wildcard GasData object to users. The object covers the gas fees for a user transaction. The GasData object covers any fee amount determined for the transaction as long as the budget is sufficient. Potential Risks Using Sponsored Transactions The most significant potential risk when using sponsored transactions is equivocation. In some cases under certain conditions, a sponsored transaction can result in all associated owned objects, including gas in a locked state when examined by Sui validators. To avoid double spending, validators lock objects as they validate transactions. An equivocation occurs when an owned object’s pair (ObjectID, SequenceNumber) is concurrently used in multiple non-finalized transactions. To equivocate, either the user or the sponsor signs and submits another transaction that attempts to manipulate an owned object in the original transaction. Because only the object owner can use an owned object, only the user and sponsor can cause this condition. Create a user-initiated sponsored transaction A user-initiated sponsored transaction involves the following steps: A user initializes a GasLessTransactionData transaction. The user sends GasLessTransactionData to the sponsor. The sponsor validates the transaction, constructs TransactionData with gas fees, and then signs TransactionData. The sponsor sends the signed TransactionData and the sponsor Signature back to the user. The user verifies and then signs TransactionData and sends the dual-signed transaction to Sui network through a Full node or the sponsor. GasLessTransactionData GasLessTransactionData is basically TransactionData without GasData. It is not a sui-core data structure, but it is only an interface between user and sponsor. The following example constructs a GasLessTransactionData object. pub\sstruct\sGasLessTransactionData\s{\n\s\s\s\spub\skind:\sTransactionKind,\n\s\s\s\ssender:\sSuiAddress,\n\s\s\s\s…\n}\n Create a sponsor-initiated sponsored transaction A sponsor-initiated sponsored transaction involves the following steps: A sponsor constructs a TransactionData object that contains the transaction details and associated gas fee data. The sponsor signs it to generate a Signature before sending it to a user. You can send the unsigned TransactionData via email, SMS, or an application interface. The user checks the transaction and signs it to generate the second Signature for the transaction. The user submits the dual-signed transaction to a Sui Full node or sponsor to execute it. You can use a sponsor-initiated sponsored transaction as an advertiser, or to incentivize specific user actions without requiring the user to pay for gas fees. Create sponsored transactions using a GasData object To use a GasData object to sponsor the gas fees for a transaction, create a GasData object that covers the fees determined for the transaction. This is similar to providing a blank check to a user that can be used only to cover gas fees. The user doesn’t need to know how much the fee is or approve it. A sponsor transaction using a GasData object involves the following steps: The sponsor provides a GasData object to a user. The user constructs TransactionData and signs it to generate a Signature. The user sends the TransactionData and the Signature to the sponsor. The sponsor confirms the TransactionData and then signs it. The sponsor submits the dual-signed TransactionData to a Full node to execute the transaction. Create a Sui Gas Station Anyone can set up and operate a Sui Gas Station to sponsor user transactions. You can customize a Sui Gas Station to support the specific user-facing functionality you need. Here are some example use cases for a Sui Gas Station: Monitor real-time gas prices on the network to determine the gas price that the station provides. Track usage of gas provided to users on the network. Gas pool management, such as using specific gas objects to minimize costs or reduce the risk of a large amount of locked objects that remain illiquid while locked. Sui Gas Station Risk Mitigation Sui supports the following mechanism to mitigate the potential risk associated with sponsored transactions. Authorization & Rate Limiting Depending on the nature of the Gas Station, sponsors can apply different authorization rules to avoid being spammed by bad actors. Possible policies include: Rate limit gas request per account or per IP address Only accept requests with a valid authorization header, which has separate rate limits Abuse Detection For all gas objects that the sponsor gives out, track if users ever try to equivocate and lock objects. If such behavior is detected, block list this user or requestor accordingly. Code examples to create a Sui Gas Station The code examples in this section demonstrate how to implement a Sui Gas Station that supports each of the sponsored transaction types described previously in this topic. User-initiated sponsored transactions Use the API endpoint to receive GaslessTransaction transactions and return a sole-signed SenderSignedData object. pub\sfn\srequest_gas_and_signature(gasless_tx:\sGaslessTransaction)\s->\sResult<SenderSignedData,\sError>;\n Sponsored transactions with GasData objects Use the API endpoint to receive sole-signed SenderSignedData and return the result of the transaction. pub\sfn\ssubmit_sole_signed_transaction(sole_signed_data:\sSenderSignedData)\s->\sResult<(Transaction,\sCertifiedTransactionEffects),\sError>;\n Alternatively, use the API endpoint to return a GasData object. pub\sfn\srequest_gas(/*requirement\sdata*/)\s->\sResult<GasData,\sError>;\n User and Sponsor-initiated transaction. Use the API endpoint to receive dual-signed SenderSignedData and return the result of the transaction. pub\sfn\ssubmit_dual_signed_transaction(dual_signed_data:\sSenderSignedData)\s->\sResult<(Transaction,\sCertifiedTransactionEffects),\sError>;\n For user and sponsor-initiated transactions, users can submit the dual-signed transaction via either a sponsor or a full node. Sponsored Transaction Data Structure The following code block describes the TransactionData structure for sponsored transactions and GasObject. You can view the source code in the Sui GitHub repository. TransactionData Structure #[derive(Debug,\sPartialEq,\sEq,\sHash,\sClone,\sSerialize,\sDeserialize)]\npub\sstruct\sTransactionData\s{\n\s\s\spub\skind:\sTransactionKind,\n\s\s\spub\ssender:\sSuiAddress,\n\s\s\spub\sgas_data:\sGasData,\n}\n GasData Structure #[derive(Debug,\sPartialEq,\sEq,\sHash,\sClone,\sSerialize,\sDeserialize)]\npub\sstruct\sGasData\s{\n\s\s\spub\spayment:\sObjectRef,\n\s\s\spub\sowner:\sSuiAddress,\n\s\s\spub\sprice:\su64,\n\s\s\spub\sbudget:\su64,\n}\n To learn more about Transaction in Sui, see Transactions.

TransactionBlockBytesunsafe_transferSui signer sui_object_id gas_budget recipient amount TransactionBlockBytes Sui’s Gas-Pricing Mechanism Sui’s gas-pricing mechanism achieves the triple outcomes of delivering users with low, predictable transaction fees, of incentivizing validators to optimize their transaction processing operations, and of preventing denial of service attacks. This delivers a good user experience to Sui users, who can focus on using the Sui network without worrying about having to forecast the current market price of gas fees. Since validators agree on a network-wide reference price at the start of each epoch, Sui users use the reference price as a credible anchor when submitting their transactions. Moreover, the price setting mechanism is designed to reward good validator behavior, thus aligning incentives between SUI token holders, the network’s operators (i.e. the validators), and its users. A unique feature of Sui’s gas price mechanism is that users pay separate fees for transaction execution and for storing the data associated with each transaction. The gas fees associated with an arbitrary transaction $\tau$ equal: $GasFees[\tau] \ = \ ComputationUnits[\tau] \times ComputationPrice[\tau] \ + \ StorageUnits[\tau] \times StoragePrice$ The gas functions $ComputationUnits[\tau]$ and $StorageUnits[\tau]$ measure the amount of computation and storage resources, respectively, required to process and store the data associated with $\tau$. The gas prices $ComputationPrice[\tau]$ and $StoragePrice$ translate the cost of computation and storage, respectively, into SUI units. The decoupling between gas units and gas prices is useful since SUI’s market price will fluctuate over time depending on demand and supply fluctuations. Computation gas prices The computation gas price $ComputationPrice[\tau]$ captures the cost of one unit of computation in SUI units. This price is set at the transaction level and submitted by the user as the transaction's gas price. Conceptually, it is useful to think about this gas price in two parts: $ComputationPrice[\tau] \ = \ ReferencePrice \ + \ Tip[\tau]$ The Sui network is designed so that a single $ReferencePrice$ exists throughout each epoch, with the $ReferencePrice$ being updated at each epoch boundary by Sui's validators. Hence, in practice, when a user submits a gas price above the $ReferencePrice$, it is useful to think of the difference as a tip paid to the network in order to get higher priority. During moments of regular network operations, users are not expected to pay tips and the vast majority of transactions will have gas prices equal to $ReferencePrice$. More generally, Sui’s gas price mechanism is intended to make the $ReferencePrice$ a credible anchor for users to use when submitting transactions to the network. Providing reasonable confidence that transactions submitted with gas prices at or close to the reference price will be executed in a timely manner. This is achieved through three core steps: Gas Price Survey: All validators are surveyed at the start of each epoch, and every validator submits their reservation price. That is, each validator states the minimum gas price at which they are willing to process transactions. The protocol orders these quotes and chooses the 2/3 percentile by stake as the reference price. The gas price survey’s goal is to set a reference price under which a quorum of validators are willing to promptly process transactions. Tallying Rule: Throughout the epoch, validators obtain signals over the operations of other validators. Each validator uses these signals to build a (subjective) evaluation over the performance of every other validator. Specifically, each validator constructs a multiplier for the stake rewards of every other validator such that validators who behave well receive boosted rewards, and validators who do not receive reduced rewards. The Tallying Rule’s goal is to create a community-enforced mechanism for encouraging validators to honor the reference gas price. Incentivized Stake Reward Distribution Rule: At the end of the epoch, the distribution of stake rewards across validators is adjusted using information from the Tallying Rule. Specifically, a global multiplier is built for every validator using the median value – weighted by stake – out of the set of individual multipliers constructed during the tallying rule. All else equal, validators that operated performantly will receive their regular stake rewards whereas validators who did not operate performantly at the reference gas price receive slashed rewards. Since stake rewards are influenced by the amount of stake each validator owns, validators are encouraged to obtain more stake by lowering gas fees and pricing out inefficient validators. This benefits Sui end users since the stake reward distribution rule incentivizes validators to deliver a more cost-efficient network. In sum, the gas price mechanism has two main forces: the tallying rule incentivizes validators to honor the quotes submitted during the gas survey, while the distribution rule incentivizes validators to submit low reservations prices. The interaction of these two forces delivers a mechanism encouraging validators to set a low network-level reference gas price – but not too low since they face penalties if they cannot honor their quotes. In other words, the gas price mechanism encourages a healthy competition for fair prices. Storage gas prices The storage gas price $StoragePrice$ captures the costs of covering one unit of storage in perpetuity, in SUI units. This price is set through governance proposals and is updated infrequently. The goal is to ensure Sui users pay for their use of on-chain data storage by depositing these fees into the storage fund and then redistributing these fees to future validators. In contrast to the computation gas price, storage prices are fixed and common for all transactions both within an epoch and across epochs until the storage price is updated. The $StoragePrice$ is set exogenously through the governance proposal with the goal of targeting the off-chain dollar cost of data storage. In the long run, as the costs of storage fall due to technological improvements and the dollar price of the SUI token evolves, governance proposals will update the price in order to reflect the new dollar target price. Gas prices as a coordination mechanism Overall, users submitting transactions with computation gas prices at or close to the current epoch’s $ReferencePrice$ and storage gas prices at the targeted $StoragePrice$ face good user experience. Sui’s gas price mechanism provides end users with credible reference prices for submitting their transactions. By incentivizing validators to elicit their true reservation prices and honor these quotes, users can credibly assume their transactions will be processed in a timely manner. Once Sui enables horizontal scaling, validators can add more workers as demand for on-chain activity scales. This increases their costs linearly at the same pace of network activity and lets them process more transactions at the same low gas prices. In cases of extreme network congestion where validators cannot scale fast enough, the tip’s presence provides a market-based congestion pricing mechanism that discourages further demand spikes by increasing the cost of transacting on the Sui platform. In the long run, Sui’s gas mechanism creates incentives for validators to optimize their hardware and operations. Validators who invest in becoming more efficient are able to honor lower gas prices and obtain a stake reward boost. Sui validators are thus encouraged to innovate and improve the experience of end users.

move-analyzer - Visual Studio Marketplace Skip to content | Marketplace Sign in Visual Studio Code>Programming Languages>move-analyzerNew to Visual Studio Code? Get it now.move-analyzerPreviewmove | 8,937 installs | (15) | FreeA language server and basic grammar for the Move programming language.InstallationLaunch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.CopyCopied to clipboardMore InfoOverviewVersion HistoryQ & ARating & Reviewmove-analyzer Provides language support for the Move programming language. Currently, this means a basic grammar and language configuration for Move (.move) that enables syntax highlighting, commenting/uncommenting, simple context-unaware completion suggestions while typing, and other basic language features in Move files. For information about Move visit the Move repository. How to Install The move-analyzer Visual Studio Code extension works via two components: the extension itself and the move-analyzer language server. 1. Installing the move-analyzer language server The move-analyzer language server is a Rust program that is part of the Move repository. It may be installed in one of two ways: Clone the Move repository yourself and build move-analyzer from its source code, which is especially useful if you will work on core Move. To do so, follow the instructions in the Move tutorial's Step 0: Installation. Use Rust's package manager cargo to install move-analyzer in your user's PATH. This is recommended for people who do not work on core Move. If you don't already have a Rust toolchain installed, you should install Rustup, which will install the latest stable Rust toolchain. Invoke cargo\sinstall\s--git\shttps://github.com/move-language/move\smove-analyzer to install the move-analyzer language server in your Cargo binary directory. On macOS and Linux, this is usually ~/.cargo/bin. You'll want to make sure this location is in your PATH environment variable. If you plan to use the language server with Move language flavors different from core Move, you should specify an additional option to cargo\sinstall command as different Move flavors may enforce different max length of the Move address type: --features\s"address20" option for Move flavors requiring 20-byte long addresses (e.g., Sui Move) and --features\s"address32" option for Move flavors requiring 32-byte long addresses (e.g., Aptos Move). To confirm that you've installed the language server program successfully, execute move-analyzer\s--version on the command line. You should see the output move-analyzer\s1.0.0. 2. Installing the move-analyzer Visual Studio Code extension Open a new window in any Visual Studio Code application version 1.55.2 or greater. Open the command palette (⇧⌘P on macOS, or use the menu item View > Command Palette...) and type Extensions: Install Extensions. This will open a panel named Extensions in the sidebar of your Visual Studio Code window. In the search bar labeled Search Extensions in Marketplace, type move-analyzer. The move-analyzer extension should appear in the list below the search bar. Click Install. Open any file that ends in .move. Or to create a new file, click Select a language, and choose the Move language. As you type, you should see that keywords and types appear in different colors. Troubleshooting If you see an error message language server executable 'move-analyzer' could not be found in the bottom-right of your Visual Studio Code screen when opening a Move file, it means that the move-analyzer executable could not be found in your PATH. You may try the following: Confirm that invoking move-analyzer\s--version in a command line terminal prints out move-analyzer\s1.0.0. If it doesn't, then retry the instructions in step 1. If it does successfully print this output, try closing and re-opening the Visual Studio Code application, as it may not have picked up the udpates to your PATH. If you installed the move-analyzer executable to a different location that is outside of your PATH, then you may have the extension look at this location by using the the Visual Studio Code settings (⌘, on macOS, or use the menu item Code > Preferences > Settings). Search for the move-analyzer.server.path setting, and set it to the location of the move-analyzer language server you installed. If the above steps don't work, then report a GitHub issue to the Move repository to get help. Features Here are some of the features of the move-analyzer Visual Studio Code extension. To see them, open a Move source file (a file with a .move file extension) and: See Move keywords and types highlighted in appropriate colors. Comment and un-comment lines of code using the ⌘/ shortcut on macOS (or the menu command Edit > Toggle Line Comment). Place your cursor on a delimiter, such as <, (, or {, and its corresponding delimiter -- >, ), or } -- will be highlighted. As you type, Move keywords will appear as completion suggestions. If the opened Move source file is located within a buildable project (a Move.toml file can be found in one of its parent directories), the following advanced features will also be available: compiler diagnostics go to definition go to type definition go to references type on hover outline view showing symbol tree for Move source files Contact usJobsPrivacyManage cookiesTerms of useTrademarks© 2023 Microsoft

sui_programmability/examples directory. Also see Sui by Example for a feature-by-feature guide to Sui Move. Here is a list of existing examples in the Sui repository. Basics In the Basics example, explore object creation, update, and exchange. Crypto In the Cryptography example, employ a simple contract to: Hash a piece of data using keccak256 and output an object with hashed data. Recover a Secp256k1 signature to its public key and output an object with the public key. Verify a Secp256k1 signature and produce an event indicating whether it is verified. DeFi In the DeFi example, find an atomic swap leveraging an escrow agent that is trusted for liveness, but not safety. Fungible Tokens In the Fungible Tokens example, see a token managed by a treasurer trusted for minting and burning for how (e.g.) a fiat-backed stablecoin would work. Games In the Games example, try out and modify toy games built on top of Sui! These include classic Tic Tac Toe, rock paper scissors, and various versions of an adventure game (Hero). NFTs In the NFTs example, browse non-fungible tokens of various types and see NFTs representing assets in a game.

Once you start programming non-trivial smart contracts on Sui, you will begin dealing with Sui objects in the code. Sui includes a rich, comprehensive library and testing framework to allow you to interact with objects in a safe yet flexible way. In this tutorial series, we will walk through all the powerful ways to interact with objects in Sui Move. At the end, we will also explore the designs of a few (close-to-)real-world examples to demonstrate the tradeoffs of using different object types and ownership relationships. Prerequisites Understand: Learn about Sui Smart Contracts with Move Sui Objects Install: Sui binaries Sui source code Chapters Chapter 1: Object Basics Defining Move object types, creating objects, transferring objects. Chapter 2: Using Objects Passing Move objects as arguments, mutating objects, deleting objects. Chapter 3: Immutable Objects Freezing an object, using immutable objects. Chapter 4: Object Wrapping Wrapping objects in another object. Chapter 5: Dynamic Fields Extending objects with fields that reference other objects, and that you can add, access, and remove dynamically. Chapter 6: Collections Working with objects in on-chain homogeneous and heterogeneous key-value stores built on top of dynamic fields. Limits on transactions, objects, and data Sui has some limits on transactions and data used in transactions, such as a maximum size and number of objects used. To view the full list of limits in source code, see Transaction input limits.

Overview Move source language is an expression-based language that aims to simplify writing Move programs---modules and scripts---without hiding the core concepts in Move bytecode. Currently, there are command line tools for Move. Move Check is used for checking code, but it does not generate bytecode Move Build is used for checking and then compiling to bytecode In the future there should be other utilities for testing and play grounding the Move modules. There is unfortunately no documentation for the language syntax or features. See the stdlib for examples. Design Principles Mission Deliver a minimalistic, expressive, safe, and transparent language to produce--and link with--Move bytecode. Primary Principles More Concise than Bytecode Move is expression based, which lends itself to concise and composed programs without the need for extra locals or structure. The Move bytecode is stack based (with the addition of local variables), so a language without stack access would need to be more verbose than the bytecode. In the Move source language, expressions allow for programming directly on the stack in a controlled and safe mode, and in that way, the language gives the same level of functionality as the bytecode but in a more concise and readable environment. Move Bytecode Transparency The Move source language tries to lift up concepts in the Move bytecode into a source language; it is not trying to hide them. The bytecode already has some strong opinions (much stronger than you might expect to find in a bytecode language), and the source language is trying to keep that programming model and line of thinking. The intention of this principle is to remove the need to write bytecode directly. Additionally, this means full interoperability with functions and types declared in published modules. Stricter than Bytecode The source language often adds additional levels of restrictions. At an expression level, this means no arbitrary manipulation of the stack (only can do so through expressions), and no dead code or unused effects. At a module level, this could mean additional warnings for unused types or un-invocable functions. At a conceptual/program level, this will also mean adding integration for formal verification. Secondary Principles Pathway of Learning Syntax choices and error messages are intended to give a natural flow of learning. For example, some of the choices around expression syntax could be changed to be more familiar to various other languages, but they would hurt the plug-n-play feeling of the expression based syntax, which might hurt developing a deeper understanding of the Move source language. Aiding Common Community Patterns As Move becomes more heavily used, common patterns for modules are likely to appear. Move might add new language features to make these patterns easier, clearer, or safer. But, they will not be added if it violates some other key design goal/principle of the language. Semantic Preserving Optimizations Optimizations are an important developer tool, as they let a programmer write code in a more natural way. However, all of the optimizations performed must be semantic preserving, to prevent any catastrophic exploits or errors from occurring in optimized code. That being said, it is not the primary goal of the Move source language to produce heavily optimized code, but it is a nice feature to have. Non-Principles Heavy Abstractions The Move source language does not intend to hide the details of the Move bytecode, this ranges from everything of references to global storage. There might be some abstractions that make interacting with these items easier, but they should always be available in Move at their most basic (bytecode equivalent) level. This does not mean that conveniences currently given by the source language, such as easy field access or implicit freezing, are against the core set of principles, but only that conveniences should not be ambiguous or opaque in how they interact at the bytecode level. Note though, this does not preclude the addition of features to the lanugage, such as access modifiers that translate to compiler-generated dynamic checks. It is just that it is not an active goal of the language to add on heavy abstractions just for the sake of obscuring bytecode design choices. Command-line options The two available programs are Move check and Move build. They can be built using cargo\sbuild\s-p\smove-compiler Or run directly with cargo\srun\s-p\smove-compiler\s--bin\smove-check\s--\s[ARGS] cargo\srun\s-p\smove-compiler\s--bin\smove-build\s--\s[ARGS] Move check is a command line tool for checking Move programs without producing bytecode move-check\s0.0.1\nCheck\sMove\ssource\scode,\swithout\scompiling\sto\sbytecode.\n\nUSAGE:\n\s\s\s\smove-check\s[OPTIONS]\s[--]\s[PATH_TO_SOURCE_FILE]...\n\nFLAGS:\n\s\s\s\s-h,\s--help\s\s\s\s\s\s\sPrints\shelp\sinformation\n\s\s\s\s-V,\s--version\s\s\s\sPrints\sversion\sinformation\n\nOPTIONS:\n\s\s\s\s-s,\s--sender\s<ADDRESS>\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sThe\ssender\saddress\sfor\smodules\sand\sscripts\n\s\s\s\s-d,\s--dependency\s<PATH_TO_DEPENDENCY_FILE>...\s\s\s\sThe\slibrary\sfiles\sneeded\sas\sdependencies\n\nARGS:\n\s\s\s\s<PATH_TO_SOURCE_FILE>...\s\s\s\sThe\ssource\sfiles\sto\scheck\n Move build is a command line tool for checking Move programs and producing serialized bytecode.

ConnectStart BuildingStart BuildingTerms of ServicePlease read these Terms of Service (the “Terms” ) and our Privacy Policy carefully because they govern your use of the website, the user interface, and devnet or other offering used for testing and/or experimentation (“Devnet”) (collectively, “Interface”) located at (the “Site”) and corresponding mobile application (“App”) offered by Sui Foundation (“Sui Foundation,” “we,” “our”), ”), which may facilitate interaction with the Sui decentralized cryptographic protocols, which we do not own or control, (the “Protocol”) allowing for activities such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), ”), blockchain games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, and wallets. To make these Terms easier to read, the Interface collectively includes the Site and the App. Sui Foundation does not own or control the Protocol. The Protocol is maintained by the open source community and unaffiliated third parties. As such, the Interface specifically excludes the Protocol. Sui Foundation does not undertake any obligations with respect to the Protocol. YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS COMPLETELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 17 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 17 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 16 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.Agreement to TermsBy using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Interface. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Interface under such Applicable Law.Privacy PolicyPlease review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Interface, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.Changes to these Terms or the InterfaceWe may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.Who May Use the Interface?The Interface is only available to users in certain jurisdictions who can use the Interface as permitted under Applicable Law. Without limitation, you must be at least 18 years of age to use the Interface. You may not attempt to access or use the Interface if you are not permitted to do so.“” OUR INTERFACE IS NOT OFFERED TO PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO RESIDE IN, ARE LOCATED IN, ARE INCORPORATED IN, OR HAVE A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS DEFINED BELOW (ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY FROM A RESTRICTED TERRITORY, A “RESTRICTED PERSON”). WE DO NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS; THEREFORE, IF YOU ARE A RESTRICTED PERSON, THEN DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE INTERFACE. USE OF A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (“VPN”) TO CIRCUMVENT THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IS PROHIBITED.(a) In order to protect the integrity of the Interface, we reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion, to block access to the Interface from certain IP addresses and unique device identifiers.(b) Tax Records and Reporting.

You are further solely responsible for independently maintaining the accuracy of any record submitted to any tax authority including any information derived from the Interface.(c) Regulatory and Compliance Suspensions or Terminations. In addition to the other suspension and termination rights in these Terms, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Interface at any time in connection with any transaction as required by Applicable Law, any governmental authority, or if we in our sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating the terms of any third-party service provider or these Terms, including, without limitation, if we reasonably believe any of your representations and warranties may be untrue or inaccurate or you are violating or have violated any of the geographical restrictions that apply to the Interface, and we will not be liable to you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Site or the Interface being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason. Such suspension or termination shall not be constituted a breach of these Terms by Sui Foundation.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Sui Foundation are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in San Mateo, California, and you and Sui Foundation each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.Dispute Resolution(a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Sui Foundation agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Sui Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.(b) Exceptions. . As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.(c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.(d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under Applicable Law.(e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.(f) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. . Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.(g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.General Terms(a) Reservation of Rights.

For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.(d) Waiver of Rights.

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Sui Foundation. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.Contact InformationIf you have any questions about these Terms or the Interface, please contact Sui Foundation at legal@sui.io.Build BeyondUnlock the freedom to build powerful on-chain assetsDevelopersDocumentationGithubWhitepaperCommunityAmbassador ProgramBlogEcosystem DirectoryEcosystem Job BoardCommunity Access Program©2023 Copyright Sui.

Additional Resources Light (default) Rust Coal Navy Ayu Sui Move by Example Publisher Publisher Object serves as a way to represent the publisher authority. The object itself does not imply any specific use case and has only two main functions: package::from_module<T> and package::from_package<T> which allow checking whether a type T belongs to a module or a package for which the Publisher object was created. We strongly advise to issue the Publisher object for most of the packages that define new Objects - it is required to set the "Display" as well as to allow the type to be traded in the "Kiosk" ecosystem. Although Publisher itself is a utility, it enables the "proof of ownership" functionality, for example, it is crucial for the Object Display. To set up a Publisher, a One-Time-Witness (OTW) is required - this way we ensure the Publisher object is initialized only once for a specific module (but can be multiple for a package) as well as that the creation function is called in the publish transaction. ///\sA\ssimple\spackage\sthat\sdefines\san\sOTW\sand\sclaims\sa\s`Publisher`\n///\sobject\sfor\sthe\ssender.\nmodule\sexamples::owner\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::tx_context::TxContext;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::package;\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sOTW\sis\sa\sstruct\swith\sonly\s`drop`\sand\sis\snamed\n\s\s\s\s///\safter\sthe\smodule\s-\sbut\suppercased.\sSee\s"One\sTime\n\s\s\s\s///\sWitness"\spage\sfor\smore\sdetails.\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sOWNER\shas\sdrop\s{}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sSome\sother\stype\sto\suse\sin\sa\sdummy\scheck\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sThisType\s{}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sAfter\sthe\smodule\sis\spublished,\sthe\ssender\swill\sreceive\n\s\s\s\s///\sa\s`Publisher`\sobject.\sWhich\scan\sbe\sused\sto\sset\sDisplay\n\s\s\s\s///\sor\smanage\sthe\stransfer\spolicies\sin\sthe\s`Kiosk`\ssystem.\n\s\s\s\sfun\sinit(otw:\sOWNER,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext)\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\spackage::claim_and_keep(otw,\sctx)\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n\n///\sA\smodule\sthat\sutilizes\sthe\s`Publisher`\sobject\sto\sgive\sa\stoken\n///\sof\sappreciation\sand\sa\s`TypeOwnerCap`\sfor\sthe\sowned\stype.\nmodule\sexamples::type_owner\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::object::{Self,\sUID};\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::tx_context::TxContext;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::package::{Self,\sPublisher};\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sTrying\sto\sclaim\sownership\sof\sa\stype\swith\sa\swrong\s`Publisher`.\n\s\s\s\sconst\sENotOwner:\su64\s=\s0;\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sA\scapability\sgranted\sto\sthose\swho\swant\san\s"objective"\n\s\s\s\s///\sconfirmation\sof\stheir\sownership\s:)\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sTypeOwnerCap<phantom\sT>\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sid:\sUID\n\s\s\s\s}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sUses\sthe\s`Publisher`\sobject\sto\scheck\sif\sthe\scaller\sowns\sthe\stype\s`T`.\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sprove_ownership<T>(\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\spublisher:\s&Publisher,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext\n\s\s\s\s):\sTypeOwnerCap<T>\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sassert!(package::from_package<T>(publisher),\sENotOwner);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sTypeOwnerCap<T>\s{\sid:\sobject::new(ctx)\s}\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n

transactions are called Programmable Transaction Blocks. Get Started To get started using Programmable Transaction Blocks, make sure that you have the latest TypeScript SDK installed. This example starts by constructing a transaction block to send Sui. If you are familiar with the legacy Sui transaction types, this is similar to a paySui transaction. To construct transactions, import the TransactionBlock class, and construct it: import\s{\sTransactionBlock\s}\sfrom\s"@mysten/sui.js";\nconst\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n Using this, you can then add transactions to this transaction block. //\sCreate\sa\snew\scoin\swith\sbalance\s100,\sbased\son\sthe\scoins\sused\sas\sgas\spayment.\n//\sYou\scan\sdefine\sany\sbalance\shere.\nconst\s[coin]\s=\stxb.splitCoins(txb.gas,\s[txb.pure(100)]);\n\n//\sTransfer\sthe\ssplit\scoin\sto\sa\sspecific\saddress.\ntxb.transferObjects([coin],\stxb.pure("0xSomeSuiAddress"));\n Note that you can attach multiple transactions of the same type to a transaction block as well. For example, to get a list of transfers, and iterate over them to transfer coins to each of them: interface\sTransfer\s{\n\s\sto:\sstring;\n\s\samount:\snumber;\n}\n\n//\sProcure\sa\slist\sof\ssome\sSui\stransfers\sto\smake:\nconst\stransfers:\sTransfer[]\s=\sgetTransfers();\n\nconst\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n\n//\sFirst,\ssplit\sthe\sgas\scoin\sinto\smultiple\scoins:\nconst\scoins\s=\stxb.splitCoins(\n\s\stxb.gas,\n\s\stransfers.map((transfer)\s=>\stxb.pure(transfer.amount))\n);\n\n//\sNext,\screate\sa\stransfer\stransaction\sfor\seach\scoin:\ntransfers.forEach((transfer,\sindex)\s=>\s{\n\s\stxb.transferObjects([coins[index]],\stxb.pure(transfer.to));\n});\n After you have the transaction block defined, you can directly execute it with a signer using signAndExecuteTransactionBlock. signer.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({\stransactionBlock:\stxb\s});\n Inputs and transactions Programmable Transaction Blocks have two key concepts: inputs and transactions. Inputs are values that are used as arguments to the transactions in the transaction block. Inputs can either be an object reference (either to an owned object, an immutable object, or a shared object), or a pure BCS value (for example, an encoded string used as an argument to a move call). Transactions are steps of execution in the transaction block. You can also use the result of previous transaction as an argument to future transactions. By combining multiple transactions together, Programmable Transaction Blocks provide a flexible way to create complex transactions. Constructing inputs Inputs are how you provide external values to transaction blocks. For example, defining an amount of Sui to transfer, or which object to pass into a Move call, or a shared object. There are currently two ways to define inputs: For objects: the txb.object(objectId) function is used to construct an input that contains an object reference. For pure values: the txb.pure(rawValue) function is used, and returns an input reference that you use in transactions. Available transactions Sui supports following transactions: txb.splitCoins(coin,\samounts) - Creates new coins with the defined amounts, split from the provided coin. Returns the coins so that it can be used in subsequent transactions. Example: txb.splitCoins(txb.gas,\s[txb.pure(100),\stxb.pure(200)]) txb.mergeCoins(destinationCoin,\ssourceCoins) - Merges the sourceCoins into the destinationCoin. Example: txb.mergeCoins(txb.object(coin1),\s[txb.object(coin2),\stxb.object(coin3)]) txb.transferObjects(objects,\saddress) - Transfers a list of objects to the specified address. Example: txb.transferObjects([txb.object(thing1),\stxb.object(thing2)],\stxb.pure(myAddress)) txb.moveCall({\starget,\sarguments,\stypeArguments\s\s}) - Executes a Move call. Returns whatever the Sui Move call returns. Example: txb.moveCall({\starget:\s'0x2::devnet_nft::mint',\sarguments:\s[txb.pure(name),\stxb.pure(description),\stxb.pure(image)]\s}) txb.makeMoveVec({\stype,\sobjects\s}) - Constructs a vector of objects that can be passed into a moveCall. This is required as there’s no way to define a vector as an input. Example: txb.makeMoveVec({\sobjects:\s[txb.object(id1),\stxb.object(id2)]\s}) txb.publish(modules,\sdependencies) - Publishes a Move package. Returns the upgrade capability object. Passing transaction results as arguments You can use the result of a transaction as an argument in a subsequent transactions. Each transaction method on the transaction builder returns a reference to the transaction result. //\sSplit\sa\scoin\sobject\soff\sof\sthe\sgas\sobject:\nconst\s[coin]\s=\stxb.splitCoins(txb.gas,\s[txb.pure(100)]);\n//\sTransfer\sthe\sresulting\scoin\sobject:\ntxb.transferObjects([coin],\stxb.pure(address));\n When a transaction returns multiple results, you can access the result at a specific index either using destructuring, or array indexes. //\sDestructuring\s(preferred,\sas\sit\sgives\syou\slogical\slocal\snames):\nconst\s[nft1,\snft2]\s=\stxb.moveCall({\starget:\s"0x2::nft::mint_many"\s});\ntxb.transferObjects([nft1,\snft2],\stxb.pure(address));\n\n//\sArray\sindexes:\nconst\smintMany\s=\stxb.moveCall({\starget:\s"0x2::nft::mint_many"\s});\ntxb.transferObjects([mintMany[0],\smintMany[1]],\stxb.pure(address));\n Use the gas coin With Programmable Transaction blocks, you can use the gas payment coin to construct coins with a set balance using splitCoin. This is useful for Sui payments, and avoids the need for up-front coin selection. You can use txb.gas to access the gas coin in a transaction block, and it is valid as input for any arguments, as long as it is used by-reference. Practically speaking, this means you can also add to the gas coin with mergeCoins and borrow it for Move functions with moveCall. You can also transfer the gas coin using transferObjects, in the event that you want to transfer all of your coin balance to another address. Get transaction block bytes If you need the transaction block bytes, instead of signing or executing the transaction block, you can use the build method on the transaction builder itself. Important: You might need to explicitly call setSender() on the transaction block to ensure that the sender field is populated. This is normally done by the signer before signing the transaction, but will not be done automatically if you’re building the transaction block bytes yourself. const\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n\n//\s...\sadd\ssome\stransactions...\n\nawait\stxb.build({\sprovider\s});\n In most cases, building requires your JSON RPC Provider to fully resolve input values. If you have transaction block bytes, you can also convert them back into a TransactionBlock class: const\sbytes\s=\sgetTransactionBlockBytesFromSomewhere();\nconst\stxb\s=\sTransactionBlock.from(bytes);\n Building Offline In the event that you want to build a transaction block offline (i.e. with no provider required), you need to fully define all of your input values, and gas configuration (see the following example). For pure values, you can provide a Uint8Array which will be used directly in the transaction. For objects, you can use the Inputs helper to construct an object reference. import\s{\sInputs\s}\sfrom\s"@mysten/sui.js";\n\n//\sFor\spure\svalues:\ntxb.pure(pureValueAsBytes);\n\n//\sFor\sowned\sor\simmutable\sobjects:\ntxb.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({\sdigest,\sobjectId,\sversion\s}));\n\n//\sFor\sshared\sobjects:\ntxb.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({\sobjectId,\sinitialSharedVersion,\smutable\s}));\n You can then omit the provider object when calling build on the transaction. If there is any required data that is missing, this will throw an error. Gas Configuration The new transaction builder comes with default behavior for all gas logic, including automatically setting the gas price, budget, and selecting coins to be used as gas. This behavior can be customized. Gas Price By default, the gas price is set to the reference gas price of the network. You can also explicitly set the gas price of the transaction block by calling setGasPrice on the transaction builder. txb.setGasPrice(gasPrice);\n Budget By default, the gas budget is automatically derived by executing a dry-run of the transaction block beforehand. The dry run gas consumption is then used to determine a balance for the transaction. You can override this behavior by explicitly setting a gas budget for the transaction, by calling setGasBudget on the transaction builder. Note: The gas budget is represented in Sui, and should take the gas price of the transaction block into account. txb.setGasBudget(gasBudgetAmount);\n Gas Payment By default, the gas payment is automatically determined by the SDK. The SDK selects all of the users coins that are not used as inputs in the transaction block. The list of coins used as gas payment will be merged down into a single gas coin before executing the transaction block, and all but one of the gas objects will be deleted. The gas coin at the 0-index will be the coin that all others are merged into. //\sNOTE:\sYou\sneed\sto\sensure\sthat\sthe\scoins\sdo\snot\soverlap\swith\sany\n//\sof\sthe\sinput\sobjects\sfor\sthe\stransaction\sblock.\ntxb.setGasPayment([coin1,\scoin2]);\n Dapp / Wallet Integration The Wallet Standard interface has been updated to support the TransactionBlock kind directly. All signTransaction and signAndExecuteTransaction calls from dapps into wallets will be expected to provide a TransactionBlock class. This transaction block class can then be serialized and sent to your wallet for execution. To serialize a transaction block for sending to a wallet, Sui recommends using the txb.serialize() function, which returns an opaque string representation of the transaction block that can be passed from the wallet standard dapp context to your wallet. This can then be converted back into a TransactionBlock using TransactionBlock.from(). Important: You should not build the transaction block from bytes in the dApp code. Using serialize instead of build allows you to build the transaction block bytes within the wallet itself. This allows the wallet to perform gas logic and coin selection as needed. //\sWithin\sa\sdApp\nconst\stx\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\nwallet.signTransactionBlock({\stransactionBlock:\stx\s});\n\n//\sYour\swallet\sstandard\scode:\nfunction\shandleSignTransactionBlock(input)\s{\n\s\ssendToWalletContext({\stransactionBlock:\sinput.transactionBlock.serialize()\s});\n}\n\n//\sWithin\syour\swallet\scontext:\nfunction\shandleSignRequest(input)\s{\n\s\sconst\suserTx\s=\sTransactionBlock.from(input.transaction);\n}\n Sponsored Transaction Blocks The transaction block builder can support sponsored transaction blocks by using the onlyTransactionKind flag when building the transaction block. const\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n\n//\s...\sadd\ssome\stransactions...\n\nconst\skindBytes\s=\sawait\stxb.build({\sprovider,\sonlyTransactionKind:\strue\s});\n\n//\sConstruct\sa\ssponsored\stransaction\sfrom\sthe\skind\sbytes:\nconst\ssponsoredTxb\s=\sTransactionBlock.fromKind(kindBytes);\n\n//\sYou\scan\snow\sset\sthe\ssponsored\stransaction\sdata\sthat\sis\srequired:\nsponsoredTxb.setSender(sender);\nsponsoredTxb.setGasOwner(sponsor);\nsponsoredTxb.setGasPayment(sponsorCoins);\n Connect to Sui JSON-RPC API Last update 3/28/2023, 5:08:20 PM Contributor(s) Randall-MystenChris LiJordan Gensler Source Code Community Discord Twitter Medium GitHub Ecosystem Sui.io Sui Resources Sui Developer Forums Send Feedback Contact us (Email) Create an Issue (GitHub) Chat about Docs (Discord) Privacy Policy Terms of Service ©2023 Copyright Sui Foundation.

contracts with Sui Move. This tutorial provides a brief explanation of the Sui Move language, and includes concrete examples to demonstrate how you can use Move in Sui. About Sui Move Sui Move is an open source language for writing safe smart contracts. It was originally developed at Facebook to power the Diem blockchain. However, Sui Move was designed as a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. The documentation for the original Move language is available in the Move GitHub repository and includes a tutorial and a book describing language features in detail. These are invaluable resources to deepen your understanding of the Move language but not strict prerequisites to following the Sui tutorial, which we strived to make self-contained. Further, Sui Move differs in some ways from Move, which we explore here. You can use Sui Move to define, create, and manage programmable Sui objects representing user-level assets. Sui's object system is implemented by adding new functionality to Move while also imposing additional restrictions, creating a dialect of Move (a.k.a. Sui Move) that makes certain parts of the original Move documentation not applicable to smart contract development in Sui. Consequently, it's best to follow this tutorial and the relevant Move documentation links within. Before looking at the Move code included with Sui, let's talk briefly about Move code organization, which applies both to code included with Sui and the custom code developers write. Move code organization The main unit of Move code organization (and distribution) is a package. A package consists of a set of modules defined in separate files with the .move extension. These files include Move functions and type definitions. A package must include the Move.toml manifest file describing package configuration, such as package metadata and package dependencies. See Move.toml for more information about package manifest files in Sui Move. Packages also include an auto-generated Move.lock file. The Move.lock file is similar in format to the package manifest, but is not meant for users to edit directly. See Move.lock for more information about the lock file in Sui Move. The minimal package source directory structure looks as follows and contains the manifest file, the lock file, and the sources subdirectory where one or more module files are located: my_move_package\n├──\sMove.lock\n├──\sMove.toml\n├──\ssources\n\s\s\s\s├──\smy_module.move\n See Package Layout and Manifest Syntax for more information on package layout. It's now time to look at some Sui Move code. You can either keep reading for an introductory description of the main Sui Move language constructs or you can jump straight into the code by writing a simple Sui Move package, and checking out additional code examples. First look at Move source code The Sui platform includes the Sui Framework, which includes the core on-chain libraries that Sui Move developers need to bootstrap Sui operations. In particular, Sui supports multiple user-defined coin types, which are custom assets the Sui Move language defines. Sui Framework code contains the Coin module supporting creation and management of custom coins. The Coin module is located in the coin.move file. As you might expect, the manifest file describing how to build the package containing the Coin module is located in the corresponding Move.toml file. Let's see how module definition appears in the Coin module file: module\ssui::coin\s{\n...\n}\n Don't worry about the rest of the module contents for now; you can read more about modules in the Move book later. Important: In Sui Move, package names are always in PascalCase, while the address alias is lowercase, for example sui\s=\s0x2 and std\s=\s0x1. So: Sui = name of the imported package (Sui = sui framework), sui = address alias of 0x2, sui::sui = module sui under the address 0x2, and sui::sui::SUI = type in the module above. When you define a module, specify the module name (coin) preceded by the name of the package where this module resides (sui). The combination of the package name and the module name uniquely identifies a module in Sui Move source code. The package name is globally unique, but different packages can contain modules with the same name. While module names are not unique, when they combine with their unique package name they result in a unique combination. For example, if you have a published package "P", you cannot publish an entirely different package also named "P". At the same time you can have module "P1::M1", "P2::M1", and "P1::M2" but not another, say, "P1::M1" in the system at the same time. While you can't name different packages the same, you can upgrade a package on chain with updated code using the same package name. In addition to having a presence at the source code level, as discussed in Sui Move code organization, a package in Sui is also a Sui object and must have a unique numeric ID in addition to a unique name, which is assigned in the manifest file: [addresses]\nsui\s=\s"0x2"\n Sui Move structs The Coin module defines the Coin struct type that you can use to represent different types of user-defined coins as Sui objects: struct\sCoin<phantom\sT>\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\sid:\sUID,\n\s\s\s\svalue:\su64\n}\n Sui Move's struct type is similar to struct types defined in other programming languages, such as C or C++, and contains a name and a set of typed fields. In particular, struct fields can be of a primitive type, such as an integer type, or of a struct type. You can read more about Move primitive types and structs in the Move book. For a Sui Move struct type to define a Sui object type, such as Coin, its first field must be id:\sUID, which is a struct type defined in the object module. The Move struct type must also have the key ability, which allows Sui's global storage to persist the object. Abilities of a Move struct are listed after the has keyword in the struct definition, and their existence (or lack thereof) helps the compiler enforce various properties on a definition or on instances of a given struct. You can read more about struct abilities in the Move book. The reason that the Coin struct can represent different types of coin is that the struct definition is parameterized with a type parameter. When you create an instance of the Coin struct, you can pass it an arbitrary concrete Move type (e.g. another struct type) to distinguish different types of coins from one another. Learn about Move type parameters known as generics and the optional phantom keyword at your leisure. In particular, one type of custom coin already defined in Sui is Coin<SUI>, which represents a token used to pay for Sui computations (more generally known as gas) - in this case, the concrete type used to parameterize the Coin struct is the SUI struct in the SUI module: struct\sSUI\shas\sdrop\s{}\n The Write a Sui Move Package topic shows how to define and instantiate custom structs. Move functions Similar to other popular programming languages, the main unit of computation in Move is a function. Let us look at one of the simplest functions defined in the Coin module, that is the value function. public\sfun\svalue<T>(self:\s&Coin<T>):\su64\s{\n\s\s\s\sself.value\n}\n Functions in other modules can call this public function to return the unsigned integer value currently stored in a given instance of the Coin struct. The Move compiler allows direct access to fields of a struct only within the module defining a given struct, as described in Privileged Struct Operations. The body of the function simply retrieves the value field from the Coin struct instance parameter and returns it. The coin parameter is a read-only reference to the Coin struct instance, indicated by the & preceding the parameter type. Move's type system enforces an invariant that struct instance arguments passed by read-only references (as opposed to mutable references) cannot be modified in the body of a function. You can read more about Move references in the Move book. The Write a Sui Move Package topic shows how to call Move functions from other functions and how to define the new ones. The Sui dialect of the Move language also defines entry functions. These must satisfy a certain set of properties and you can call them directly from Sui (e.g., from a Sui application written in a different language). Entry functions One of the basic operations in Sui is a gas object transfer between addresses representing individual users. The gas object transfer implementation in the SUI module is also an example of the use of an entry function: public\sentry\sfun\stransfer(c:\scoin::Coin<SUI>,\srecipient:\saddress,\s_ctx:\s&mut\sTxContext)\s{\n\s\s\s\s...\n}\n Don't worry about the function body for now - because the function is part of Sui framework, you can trust that it will do what it is intended to do. In general, an entry function must satisfy the following properties: Has the entry modifier. The visibility does not matter. The function can be public, public(friend), or internal. Has no return value (Optional) Has a mutable reference to an instance of the TxContext struct defined in the TxContext module as the last parameter. More concretely, the transfer function is public, has no return value, and has three parameters: c - Represents a gas object whose ownership is to be transferred. recipient - The address of the intended recipient _ctx - A mutable reference to an instance of the TxContext struct (in this particular case, this parameter is not actually used in the function's body as indicated by its name starting with _). Because it is unused, the parameter could be removed. The mutable reference to the TxContext is optional for entry functions. Calling Move code describes how to call the transfer function from the Sui CLI client.

In Sui, the database snapshot captures a running database's view of the Sui network from a particular node at the end of an epoch. While validators can enable snapshots, they are typically most valuable for Full node operators. Snapshots of the Sui network enable Full node operators a way to bootstrap a Full node without having to execute all the transactions that occurred after genesis. You can upload snapshots to remote object stores like S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and similar services. These services typically run the export process in the background so there is no degradation in performance for your Full node. With snapshots stored in the cloud, you're more easily able to recover quickly from catastrophic failures in your system or hardware. Enabling snapshots Full nodes do not take snapshots by default. To enable this feature: Stop your node, if it's running. Open your fullnode.yaml config file. Add an entry to the config file for db-checkpoint-config. Using Amazon's S3 service as an example: db-checkpoint-config:\n\s\sperform-db-checkpoints-at-epoch-end:\strue\n\s\sobject-store-config:\n\s\s\s\sobject-store:\s"S3"\n\s\s\s\sbucket:\s"<BUCKET-NAME>"\n\s\s\s\saws-access-key-id:\s“<ACCESS-KEY>”\n\s\s\s\saws-secret-access-key:\s“<SHARED-KEY>”\n\s\s\s\saws-region:\s"<BUCKET-REGION>"\n\s\s\s\sobject-store-connection-limit:\s20\n object-store: The remote object store to upload snapshots. Set as Amazon's S3 service in the example. bucket: The S3 bucket name to store the snapshots. aws-access-key-id and aws-secret-access-key: AWS authentication information with write access to the bucket. aws-region: Region where buck exists. object-store-connection-limit: Number of simultaneous connections to the object store. Save the sui-node.yaml file and restart the node. Restoring from snapshots To restore from a snapshot, follow these steps: Download the snapshot for the epoch you want to restore to your local disk. There is one snapshot per epoch in s3 bucket. Place the snapshot into the directory that the db-config value points to in your sui-node.yaml file. For example, if the db-config value points to /opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db and you want to restore from epoch 10, then copy the snapshot to the directory with this command: aws\ss3\scp\s\ss3://<BUCKET_NAME>/epoch_10\s/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/epoch_10\s--recursive Mark downloaded snapshot as live: mv\s\s/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/epoch_10\s\s/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live sudo\schown\s-R\ssui:sui\s\s/opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live Start the Sui node. Note: when you restore a Full node from a snapshot, write it to the path /opt/sui/db/authorities_db/full_node_db/live. To restore a Validator node, use the path /opt/sui/db/authorities_db/live S3 buckets used per environment Testnet: s3://suidb-snapshots/ Mainnet: TBD Sui Validator Node Event Query and Subscription Last update 4/12/2023, 5:37:02 PM Contributor(s) Randall-Mystenronny-mysten Source Code Community Discord Twitter Medium GitHub Ecosystem Sui.io Sui Resources Sui Developer Forums Send Feedback Contact us (Email) Create an Issue (GitHub) Chat about Docs (Discord) Privacy Policy Terms of Service ©2023 Copyright Sui Foundation.

allows for on-chain management of off-chain representation (display) for a type. With it, you can substitute data for an object into a template string. The standard doesn’t limit the fields you can set. You can use the {property} syntax to access all object properties, and then insert them as a part of the template string. Use a Publisher object that you own to set sui::display for a type. For more information about Publisher objects, see Publisher topic in Sui Move by Example. In Sui Move, Display<T> represents an object that specifies a set of named templates for the type T. For example, for a type 0x2::capy::Capy the display syntax is: Display<0x2::capy::Capy>. Sui Full nodes process all objects of the type T by matching the Display definition, and return the processed result when you query an object with the {\sshowDisplay:\strue\s} setting in the query. Display properties The basic set of properties suggested includes: name - A name for the object. The name is displayed when users view the object. description - A description for the object. The description is displayed when users view the object. link - A link to the object to use in an application. image_url - A URL or a blob with the image for the object. project_url - A link to a website associated with the object or creator. creator - A string that indicates the object creator. An example Sui Hero module The following code sample demonstrates how the Display for an example Hero module varies based on the name, id, and image_url properties of the type Hero. The following represents the template the init function defines: {\n\s\s\s\s"name":\s"{name}",\n\s\s\s\s"link":\s"https://sui-heroes.io/hero/{id}",\n\s\s\s\s"image_url":\s"ipfs://{img_url}",\n\s\s\s\s"description":\s"A\strue\sHero\sof\sthe\sSui\secosystem!",\n\s\s\s\s"project_url":\s"https://sui-heroes.io",\n\s\s\s\s"creator":\s"Unknown\sSui\sFan"\n}\n\n///\sExample\sof\san\sunlimited\s"Sui\sHero"\scollection\s-\sanyone\scan\n///\smint\stheir\sHero.\sShows\show\sto\sinitialize\sthe\s`Publisher`\sand\show\n///\sto\suse\sit\sto\sget\sthe\s`Display<Hero>`\sobject\s-\sa\sway\sto\sdescribe\sa\n///\stype\sfor\sthe\secosystem.\nmodule\sexamples::my_hero\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::tx_context::{sender,\sTxContext};\n\s\s\s\suse\sstd::string::{utf8,\sString};\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::transfer::transfer;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::object::{Self,\sUID};\n\n\s\s\s\s//\sThe\screator\sbundle:\sthese\stwo\spackages\soften\sgo\stogether.\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::package;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::display;\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sThe\sHero\s-\san\soutstanding\scollection\sof\sdigital\sart.\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sHero\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sid:\sUID,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sname:\sString,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\simg_url:\sString,\n\s\s\s\s}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sOne-Time-Witness\sfor\sthe\smodule.\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sMY_HERO\shas\sdrop\s{}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sIn\sthe\smodule\sinitializer\sone\sclaims\sthe\s`Publisher`\sobject\n\s\s\s\s///\sto\sthen\screate\sa\s`Display`.\sThe\s`Display`\sis\sinitialized\swith\n\s\s\s\s///\sa\sset\sof\sfields\s(but\scan\sbe\smodified\slater)\sand\spublished\svia\n\s\s\s\s///\sthe\s`update_version`\scall.\n\s\s\s\s///\n\s\s\s\s///\sKeys\sand\svalues\sare\sset\sin\sthe\sinitializer\sbut\scould\salso\sbe\n\s\s\s\s///\sset\safter\spublishing\sif\sa\s`Publisher`\sobject\swas\screated.\n\s\s\s\sfun\sinit(otw:\sMY_HERO,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext)\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\skeys\s=\svector[\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"name"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"link"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"image_url"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"description"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"project_url"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"creator"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s];\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\svalues\s=\svector[\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sFor\s`name`\sone\scan\suse\sthe\s`Hero.name`\sproperty\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"{name}"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sFor\s`link`\sone\scan\sbuild\sa\sURL\susing\san\s`id`\sproperty\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"https://sui-heroes.io/hero/{id}"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sFor\s`image_url`\swe\suse\san\sIPFS\stemplate\s+\s`img_url`\sproperty.\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"ipfs://{img_url}"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sDescription\sis\sstatic\sfor\sall\s`Hero`\sobjects.\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"A\strue\sHero\sof\sthe\sSui\secosystem!"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sProject\sURL\sis\susually\sstatic\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"https://sui-heroes.io"),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sCreator\sfield\scan\sbe\sany\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sutf8(b"Unknown\sSui\sFan")\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s];\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sClaim\sthe\s`Publisher`\sfor\sthe\spackage!\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\spublisher\s=\spackage::claim(otw,\sctx);\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sGet\sa\snew\s`Display`\sobject\sfor\sthe\s`Hero`\stype.\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\sdisplay\s=\sdisplay::new_with_fields<Hero>(\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s&publisher,\skeys,\svalues,\sctx\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s);\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\sCommit\sfirst\sversion\sof\s`Display`\sto\sapply\schanges.\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sdisplay::update_version(&mut\sdisplay);\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\stransfer(publisher,\ssender(ctx));\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\stransfer(display,\ssender(ctx));\n\s\s\s\s}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sAnyone\scan\smint\stheir\s`Hero`!\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\smint(name:\sString,\simg_url:\sString,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext):\sHero\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\sid\s=\sobject::new(ctx);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sHero\s{\sid,\sname,\simg_url\s}\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n Work with Object Display The display::new<T> call creates a Display, either in a custom function or module initializer, or as part of a programmable transaction. The following code sample demonstrates how to create a Display: module\ssui::display\s{\n\s\s\s\s///\sGet\sa\snew\sDisplay\sobject\sfor\sthe\s`T`.\n\s\s\s\s///\sPublisher\smust\sbe\sthe\spublisher\sof\sthe\sT,\s`from_package`\n\s\s\s\s///\scheck\sis\sperformed.\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\snew<T>(pub:\s&Publisher):\sDisplay<T>\s{\s/*\s...\s*/\s}\n}\n After you create the Display, you can modify it. The following code sample demonstrates how to modify a Display: module\ssui::display\s{\n\s\s\s\s///\sSets\smultiple\sfields\sat\sonce\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sadd_multiple(\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sself:\s&mut\sDisplay,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\skeys:\svector<String>,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\svalues:\svector<String>\n\s\s\s\s)\s{\s/*\s...\s*/\s}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sEdit\sa\ssingle\sfield\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sedit(self:\s&mut\sDisplay,\skey:\sString,\svalue:\sString)\s{\s/*\s...\s*/\s}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sRemove\sa\skey\sfrom\sDisplay\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sremove(self:\s&mut\sDisplay,\skey:\sString\s)\s{\s/*\s...\s*/\s}\n}\n Next, the update_version call applies the changes and sets the Display for the T by emitting an event. Full nodes receive the event and use the data in the event to retrieve a template for the type. The following code sample demonstrates how to use the update_version call: module\ssui::display\s{\n\s\s\s\s///\sUpdate\sthe\sversion\sof\sDisplay\sand\semit\san\sevent\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\supdate_version(self:\s&mut\sDisplay)\s{\s/*\s...\s*/\s}\n}\n Sui utility objects In Sui, utility objects enable authorization for capabilities. Almost all modules have features that can be accessed only with the required capability. Generic modules allow one capability per application, such as a marketplace. Some capabilities mark ownership of a shared object on-chain, or access the shared data from another account. With capabilities, it is important to provide a meaningful description of objects to facilitate user interface implementation. This helps avoid accidentally transferring the wrong object when objects are similar. It also provides a user-friendly description of items that users see. The following example demonstrates how to create a capy capability: module\scapy::utility\s{\n\s\s\s///\sA\scapability\swhich\sgrants\sCapy\sManager\spermission\sto\sadd\n\s\s\s///\snew\sgenes\sand\smanage\sthe\sCapy\sMarket\n\s\s\sstruct\sCapyManagerCap\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\sid:\sUID\s}\n}\n Typical objects with data duplication A common case with in-game items is to have a large number of similar objects grouped by some criteria. It is important to optimize their size and the cost to mint and update them. Typically, a game uses a single source image or URL per group or item criteria. Storing the source image inside of every object is not optimal. In some cases, users mint in-game items when a game allows them or when they purchase an in-game item. To enable this, some IPFS/Arweave metadata must be created and stored in advance. This requires additional logic that is usually not related to the in-game properties of the item. The following example demonstrates how to create a Capy: module\scapy::capy_items\s{\n\s\s\s///\sA\swearable\sCapy\sitem.\sFor\ssome\sitems\sthere\scan\sbe\san\n\s\s\s///\sunlimited\ssupply.\sAnd\sitems\swith\sthe\ssame\sname\sare\sidentical.\n\s\s\sstruct\sCapyItem\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sid:\sUID,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sname:\sString\n\s\s\s}\n}\n Unique objects with dynamic representation Sui Capys use dynamic image generation. When a Capy is born, its attributes determine the Capy’s appearance, such as color or pattern. When a user puts an item on a Capy, the Capy’s appearance changes. When users put multiple items on a Capy, there’s a chance of a bonus for a combination of items. To implement this, the Capys game API service refreshes the image in response to a user-initiated change. The URL for a Capy is a template with the capy.id. But storing the full URL - as well as other fields in the Capy object due to their diverse population - also leads to users paying for excess storage and increased gas fees. The following example demonstrates how to implement dynamic image generation: module\scapy::capy\s{\n\s\s\s///\sA\sCapy\s-\svery\sdiverse\sobject\swith\sdifferent\scombination\n\s\s\s///\sof\sgenes.\sCreated\sdynamically\s+\sfor\simages\sa\sdynamic\sSVG\n\s\s\s///\sgeneration\sis\sused.\n\s\s\sstruct\sCapy\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\sid:\sUID,\n\s\s\s\sgenes:\svector<u8>\n\s\s\s}\n}\n Objects with unique static content This is the simplest scenario - an object represents everything itself. It is very easy to apply a metadata standard to an object of this kind, especially if the object stays immutable forever. However, if the metadata standard evolves and some ecosystem projects add new features for some properties, this object always stays in its original form and might require backward-compatible changes. module\ssui::devnet_nft\s{\n\s\s\s///\sA\sCollectible\swith\sa\sstatic\sdata.\sURL,\sname,\sdescription\sare\n\s\s\s///\sset\sonly\sonce\son\sa\smint\sevent\n\s\s\sstruct\sDevNetNFT\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\sid:\sUID,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\sname:\sString,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\sdescription:\sString,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\surl:\sUrl,\n\s\s\s}\n}\n Sui Gas Charges Create Smart Contracts with Move Last update 3/23/2023, 10:37:01 PM Contributor(s) Randall-Mysten Source Code Community Discord Twitter Medium GitHub Ecosystem Sui.io Sui Resources Sui Developer Forums Send Feedback Contact us (Email) Create an Issue (GitHub) Chat about Docs (Discord) Privacy Policy Terms of Service ©2023 Copyright Sui Foundation.

LearnEcosystem DirectorySui AmbassadorsSubscribe to our newsletter. Get news, updates, and insights. ConnectStart BuildingStart BuildingSecure thenetwork through decentralizationValidators are key to Sui’s operations and performanceBecome a ValidatorView all ValidatorsIndependent validators are the backbone of the Sui network. Validators run unique instances of the Sui software on independent machines and are collectively responsible for securing the network. They process transactions and participate in consensus to ensure Sui is the safest network possible.As a permissionless network, anyone with the appropriate setup and sufficient stake can become a validator. Sui uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) to determine which validators operate the network and their voting power. How Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) WorksOperations are processed by a set of validators, each with a specific amount of stake from SUI token holders. A validator's share of the total stake on the network determines each validator’s voting power for processing transactions. Staking SUI implies that the SUI tokens are locked for a fixed duration, called an epoch. SUI token holders are free to withdraw their SUI or to move their stake to a new validator when an epoch changes.Staking Rewards for Good BehaviorValidators provide a service to Sui by operating and securing the network. In exchange, they are compensated with commissions from staking rewards. In the early phases of the network, staking rewards are made up of stake subsidies plus gas fees. The subsidies are necessary as gas fees will likely be relatively low. In the long run, the entirety of rewards will be gas fees.How Rewards are DistributedValidators receive a share of stake rewards based mostly on their share of total stake on the network. The size of the Storage Fund and the validator’s Tallying Rule score also play a part.The Storage Fund redistributes storage fees from past transactions to validators based on current network storage requirements. When storage requirements are high, rewards are boosted to compensate for increased costs and vice versa when requirements are low.The Tallying Rule is a way for validators to monitor one another to ensure efficient operations that serve the best interest of the network. Validators score every other validator on their behavior and low scoring validators can be penalized with reduced stake rewards.Build BeyondUnlock the freedom to build powerful on-chain assetsDevelopersDocumentationGithubWhitepaperCommunityAmbassador ProgramBlogEcosystem DirectoryEcosystem Job BoardCommunity Access Program©2023 Copyright Sui.

the Sui network. This document walks you through how to connect and interact with the Sui network using the Sui JSON-RPC API. Use the RPC layer to send your dApp transactions to Sui validators for verification. This guide is useful for developers interested in Sui network interactions via API and should be used in conjunction with the SuiJSON format for aligning JSON inputs with Move Call arguments. For a similar guide on Sui network interactions via CLI, refer to the Sui Client CLI documentation. Follow the instructions to install Sui binaries. Connect to a Sui network You can connect to a Sui Full node on a Sui network. Follow the guidance in the Connect to Sui Devnet topic to start making RPC calls to the Sui network. To configure your own Sui Full node, see Configure a Sui Full node. Sui SDKs You can sign transactions and interact with the Sui network using any of the following: Sui Rust SDK , a collection of Rust language JSON-RPC wrapper and crypto utilities. Sui TypeScript SDK and reference files. Sui API Reference for all available methods. Sui JSON-RPC examples The following sections demonstrate how to use the Sui JSON-RPC API with cURL commands. See the Sui API Reference for the latest list of all available methods. RPC discover Sui RPC server supports OpenRPC’s service discovery method. A rpc.discover method is added to provide documentation describing our JSON-RPC APIs service. curl\s--location\s--request\sPOST\s$SUI_RPC_HOST\s\\n--header\s'Content-Type:\sapplication/json'\s\\n--data-raw\s'{\s"jsonrpc":"2.0",\s"method":"rpc.discover","id":1}'\n Transfer object The examples in this section demonstrate how to create transfer transactions. To use the example commands, replace the values between double brackets ({{ example_ID }} with actual values. Objects IDs for {{coin_object_id}} and {{gas_object_id}} must be owned by the address specified for {{owner_address}} for the command to succeed. Use sui_getOwnedObjects to return object IDs. Important: As a security best practice, you should serialize data from the JSON-RPC service locally in the same location as the signer. This reduces the risk of trusting data from the service directly. Create an unsigned transaction to transfer a Sui coin from one address to another curl\s--location\s--request\sPOST\s$SUI_RPC_HOST\s\\n--header\s'Content-Type:\sapplication/json'\s\\n--data-raw\s'{\n\s\s"jsonrpc":\s"2.0",\n\s\s"id":\s1,\n\s\s"method":\s"sui_transferObject",\n\s\s"params":[\n\s\s\s\s"{{owner_address}}",\n\s\s\s\s"{{object_id}}",\n\s\s\s\s"{{gas_object_id}}",\n\s\s\s\s{{gas_budget}},\n\s\s\s\s"{{to_address}}"],\n}'\s|\sjson_pp\n A response resembles the following: {\n\s\s"id":\s1,\n\s\s"jsonrpc":\s"2.0",\n\s\s"result":\s{\n\s\s\s\s"tx_bytes":\s"VHJhbnNhY3Rpb25EYXRhOjoAAFHe8jecgzoGWyGlZ1sJ2KBFN8aZF7NIkDsM+3X8mrVCa7adg9HnVqUBAAAAAAAAACDOlrjlT0A18D0DqJLTU28ChUfRFtgHprmuOGCHYdv8YVHe8jecgzoGWyGlZ1sJ2KBFN8aZdZnY6h3kyWFtB38Wyg6zjN7KzAcBAAAAAAAAACDxI+LSHrFUxU0G8bPMXhF+46hpchJ22IHlpPv4FgNvGOgDAAAAAAAA="\n\s\s}\n}\n Sign a transaction using the Sui keytool sui\skeytool\ssign\s--address\s<owner_address>\s--data\s<tx_bytes>\n The keytool creates a key and then returns the signature and public key information. Execute a transaction with a serialized signature curl\s--location\s--request\sPOST\s$SUI_RPC_HOST\s\\n--header\s'Content-Type:\sapplication/json'\s\\n--data-raw\s'{\n\s\s"jsonrpc":\s"2.0",\n\s\s"id":\s1,\n\s\s"method":\s"sui_executeTransactionBlockSerializedSig",\n\s\s"params":\s[\n\s\s\s\s"{{tx_bytes}}",\n\s\s\s\s"{{signature}}",\n\s\s\s\s"{{request_type}}"\n\s\s]\n}'\s|\sjson_pp\n signature is a Base64 encoded flag\s||\ssignature\s||\spubkey. Native transfer by sui_transferObject supports any object that allows for public transfers. Some objects cannot be transferred natively and require a Move call. See Transactions for more information about native transfers. Invoke Move functions The example command in this section demonstrate how to call Move functions. Execute a Move call transaction Execute a Move call transaction by calling the specified function in the module of a given package (smart contracts in Sui are written in the Move language): curl\s--location\s--request\sPOST\s$SUI_RPC_HOST\s\\n--header\s'Content-Type:\sapplication/json'\s\\n--data-raw\s'{\n\s\s"jsonrpc":\s"2.0",\n\s\s"method":\s"sui_moveCall",\n\s\s"params":\s[\n\s\s\s\s"{{owner_address}}",\n\s\s\s\s"0x2",\n\s\s\s\s"coin",\n\s\s\s\s"transfer",\n\s\s\s\s["0x2::sui::sui"],\n\s\s\s\s["{{object_id}}",\s"{{recipient_address}}"],\n\s\s\s\s"{{gas_object_id}}",\n\s\s\s\s\s2000\n\s\s],\n\s\s"id":\s1\n}'\s|\sjson_pp\n Arguments are passed in, and type is inferred from the function signature. Gas usage is capped by the gas_budget. The transfer function is described in more detail in the Sui CLI client documentation. The transfer function in the Coin module serves the same purpose as (sui_transferObject). It is used for illustration purposes, as a native transfer is more efficient. To learn more about which args a Move call accepts, see SuiJSON. Publish a Move package curl\s--location\s--request\sPOST\s$SUI_RPC_HOST\s\\n--header\s'Content-Type:\sapplication/json'\s\\n--data-raw\s'{\n\s\s"jsonrpc":"2.0",\n\s\s"method":"sui_publish",\n\s\s"params":[\n\s\s\s\s"{{owner_address}}",\n\s\s\s\s["{{vector_of_compiled_modules}}"],\n\s\s\s\s["{{vector_of_dependency_ids}}"],\n\s\s\s\s"{{gas_object_id}}",\n\s\s\s\s\s10000\n\s\s\s],\n\s\s"id":1\n}'\s|\sjson_pp\n This endpoint performs proper verification and linking to make sure the package is valid. If some modules have initializers, these initializers execute in Move (which means new Move objects can be created in the process of publishing a Move package). Gas budget is required because of the need to execute module initializers. To publish a Move module, you also need to include {{vector_of_compiled_modules}} along with the {{vector_of_dependency_ids}}. To generate the values for these fields, use the sui\smove command. The sui\smove command supports printing the bytecode as base64 and dependency object IDs: sui\smove\s<move-module-path>\sbuild\s--dump-bytecode-as-base64\n Assuming that the location of the package's sources is in the PATH_TO_PACKAGE environment variable an example command resembles the following: sui\smove\s$PATH_TO_PACKAGE/my_move_package\sbuild\s--dump-bytecode-as-base64\n\n{\n\s\s"modules":\s"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",\s"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",\n\s\s"dependencies":\s["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"],\n}\nBuild\sSuccessful\n Copy the output base64 representation of the compiled Move module along with the dependency IDs into the REST publish endpoint.

LearnEcosystem DirectorySui AmbassadorsSubscribe to our newsletter. Get news, updates, and insights. ConnectStart BuildingStart BuildingTerms of ServicePlease read these Terms of Service (the “Terms” ) and our Privacy Policy carefully because they govern your use of the website, the user interface, and devnet or other offering used for testing and/or experimentation (“Devnet”) (collectively, “Interface”) located at (the “Site”) and corresponding mobile application (“App”) offered by Sui Foundation (“Sui Foundation,” “we,” “our”), ”), which may facilitate interaction with the Sui decentralized cryptographic protocols, which we do not own or control, (the “Protocol”) allowing for activities such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), ”), blockchain games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, and wallets. To make these Terms easier to read, the Interface collectively includes the Site and the App. Sui Foundation does not own or control the Protocol. The Protocol is maintained by the open source community and unaffiliated third parties. As such, the Interface specifically excludes the Protocol. Sui Foundation does not undertake any obligations with respect to the Protocol. YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS COMPLETELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 17 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 17 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 16 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.Agreement to TermsBy using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Interface. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Interface under such Applicable Law.Privacy PolicyPlease review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Interface, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.Changes to these Terms or the InterfaceWe may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.Who May Use the Interface?The Interface is only available to users in certain jurisdictions who can use the Interface as permitted under Applicable Law. Without limitation, you must be at least 18 years of age to use the Interface.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Sui Foundation are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in San Mateo, California, and you and Sui Foundation each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.Dispute Resolution(a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Sui Foundation agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Sui Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.(b) Exceptions. . As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.(c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.(d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under Applicable Law.(e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.(f) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. . Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.(g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.General Terms(a) Reservation of Rights.

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by Applicable Law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Sui Foundation’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, will be null. Sui Foundation may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.(c) Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Sui Foundation under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Interface. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.(d) Waiver of Rights.

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Sui Foundation. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.Contact InformationIf you have any questions about these Terms or the Interface, please contact Sui Foundation at legal@sui.io.Build BeyondUnlock the freedom to build powerful on-chain assetsDevelopersDocumentationGithubWhitepaperCommunityAmbassador ProgramBlogEcosystem DirectoryEcosystem Job BoardCommunity Access Program©2023 Copyright Sui.

Once you start programming non-trivial smart contracts on Sui, you will begin dealing with Sui objects in the code. Sui includes a rich, comprehensive library and testing framework to allow you to interact with objects in a safe yet flexible way. In this tutorial series, we will walk through all the powerful ways to interact with objects in Sui Move. At the end, we will also explore the designs of a few (close-to-)real-world examples to demonstrate the tradeoffs of using different object types and ownership relationships. Prerequisites Understand: Learn about Sui Smart Contracts with Move Sui Objects Install: Sui binaries Sui source code Chapters Chapter 1: Object Basics Defining Move object types, creating objects, transferring objects. Chapter 2: Using Objects Passing Move objects as arguments, mutating objects, deleting objects. Chapter 3: Immutable Objects Freezing an object, using immutable objects. Chapter 4: Object Wrapping Wrapping objects in another object. Chapter 5: Dynamic Fields Extending objects with fields that reference other objects, and that you can add, access, and remove dynamically. Chapter 6: Collections Working with objects in on-chain homogeneous and heterogeneous key-value stores built on top of dynamic fields. Limits on transactions, objects, and data Sui has some limits on transactions and data used in transactions, such as a maximum size and number of objects used. To view the full list of limits in source code, see Transaction input limits.

Gas Station Guide Jump to ContentGuidesAPI ReferenceChangelogv1.0Log InLog Inv1.0GuidesAPI ReferenceChangelogSearchShinami GuidesWelcome to ShinamiGas Station GuideSponsored Transaction TypeScript TutorialGaming Integration GuideSui Network and Client CompatibilityError ReferenceSui GuidesSui Move ResourcesSui GlossaryPowered by Gas Station GuideShinami’s Gas Station allows apps on Sui to abstract away gas feesSuggest EditsBackground Sending a transaction on Sui requires end users to first have a SUI balance in order to pay gas fees. This typically involves KYC & AML checks to purchase SUI and interact with apps on the network. Alternatively, apps on Sui can sponsor their end user's transactions to remove friction. Shinami handles the management, refueling and optimization of gas (SUI) to facilitate sponsored transactions. This frees apps to focus on how to apply sponsored transactions to improve onboarding and user engagement. Parties End user - sender of the transaction. Has a wallet and Sui address. App (sponsor) - the app funding transactions on behalf of end users Gas station (Shinami) - manager of gas objects for sponsors, and facilitator of sponsored transactions Wallet - interface for the end user to interact with the the app and node service Node service (Shinami) - endpoint for transactions to be submitted to 📘Role of Shinami's Node ServiceShinami’s node service provides enterprise-grade infrastructure to read and write to the Sui blockchain. The gas station leverages this infrastructure when tracking state and it's also used to submit sponsored transactions to Sui. Gas Station API Shinami provides easy to use APIs for sponsoring transactions. Once you've created a gas station access key in the Shinami dashboard, you can make the following JSON-RPC requests: gas_sponsorTransactionBlock: sponsors a transaction by attaching a gas object to it and signs the sponsored transaction with the gas owner's key gas_getSponsoredTransactionBlockStatus: retrieve the status of a sponsored transaction (IN_FLIGHT, INVALID, or COMPLETE). You can find more information on these methods in our Gas Station API page. End-to-end Scenario App funds its gas station account for sponsorship in the Shinami dashboard. End user is interacting with an app (sponsor) with a connected wallet and wants to perform a transaction, e.g. mint an NFT. App constructs the mint NFT transaction gaslessly under the hood (check out our TypeScript tutorial for examples). App sends it to the Shinami Gas Station via gas_sponsorTransactionBlock Gas station: Puts a hold on the app's funds for the specified gas budget amount Constructs the transaction data to mint the NFT with a provisioned gas object Signs the transaction and returns the transaction data with gas back to the app App presents the transaction to the end user and prompts for signature via wallet. Wallet submits the transaction to the Sui network (sui_executeTransactionBlock) Updated about 8 hours ago Table of Contents Background Parties Gas Station API End-to-end Scenario

model and highlights the differences between the core (previously Diem) Move language and the Move used in Sui. To learn more about the motivations behind creating Sui Move, see Why We Created Sui Move. In general, Move code written for other systems will work in Sui with these exceptions: Global Storage operators Key Abilities Here is a summary of key differences: Sui uses its own object-centric global storage Addresses represent Object IDs Sui objects have globally unique IDs Sui has module initializers (init) Sui entry points take object references as input Find a detailed description of each change below. Object-centric global storage In core Move, global storage is part of the programming model and can be accessed through special operations, such as move_to, move_from and many more global storage operators. Both resources and modules are stored in the core Move global storage. When you publish a module, it’s stored into a newly generated module address inside Move. When a new object (a.k.a. resource) is created, it's usually stored into some address, as well. But on-chain storage is expensive and limited (not optimized for storage and indexing). Current blockchains cannot scale to handle storage-heavy applications such as marketplaces and social apps. So there is no global storage in Sui Move. None of the global storage-related operations are allowed in Sui Move. (We have a bytecode verifier for this to detect violations.) Instead, storage happens exclusively within Sui. When we publish a module, the newly published module is stored in Sui storage, instead of Move storage. Similarly, newly created objects are stored in Sui storage. This also means that when we need to read an object in Move, we cannot rely on global storage operations but instead Sui must explicitly pass all objects that need to be accessed into Move. Addresses represent Object IDs In Move, there is a special address type. This type is used to represent addresses in core Move. Core Move needs to know the address of an account when dealing with the global storage. The address type is 16 bytes, which is sufficient for the core Move security model. In Sui, since we don’t support global storage in Move, we don’t need the address type to represent user accounts. Instead, we use the address type to represent the Object ID. Refer to the object.move file in Sui framework for an understanding of address use. Object with key ability, globally unique IDs We need a way to distinguish between objects that are internal to Sui Move and objects that can be stored in Sui storage. This is important because we need to be able to serialize/deserialize objects in the Move-Sui boundary, and this process makes assumptions on the shape of the objects. We take advantage of the key ability in Move to annotate a Sui object. In core Move, the key ability is used to tell that the type can be used as a key for global storage. Since we don’t touch global storage in Sui Move, we are able to repurpose this ability. We require that any struct with key ability must start with an id field with the ID type. The ID type contains both the ObjectID and the sequence number (a.k.a. version). We have bytecode verifiers in place to make sure that the ID field is immutable and cannot be transferred to other objects (as each object must have a unique ID). Module initializers As described in Object-centric global storage, Sui Move modules are published into Sui storage. A special initializer function optionally defined in a module is executed (once) at the time of module publication by the Sui runtime for the purpose of pre-initializing module-specific data (e.g., creating singleton objects). The initializer function must have the following properties in order to be executed at publication: Name init Single parameter of &mut\sTxContext type No return values Private Entry points take object references as input Sui offers entry functions that can be called directly from Sui, in addition to functions callable from other functions. See Entry functions. Conclusion In summary, Sui takes advantage of Move’s security and flexibility and enhances it with the features described above to vastly improve throughput, reduce delays in finality, and make Sui Move programming easier. Now see how Sui works. For full details, see the Sui Smart Contracts Platform white paper. Why Move?

provides in terms of Security. Sui asset owners and smart contract designers can start learning here about the mechanisms available to secure their assets, and the assurances Sui provides for them. Smart contract designers can also learn about the overall Sui security architecture to ensure the asset types they design leverage Sui to provide a secure experience to the asset holders. Security features Sui is designed to provide very high security guarantees to asset owners. Assets on Sui can be used only by their owners, according to the logic pre-defined by smart contracts that can be audited, and that the network will be available to process them correctly despite some of the validators operating Sui not following the protocol correctly (fault tolerance). The security features of the Sui system ensure a number of properties: Only the owner of an owned asset can authorize a transaction that operates on this asset. Authorization is performed through the use of a private signature key that is known only to the asset owner. Everyone can operate on shared assets or immutable assets, but additional access control logic can be implemented by the smart contract. Transactions operate on assets according to predefined rules set by the smart contract creator that defined the asset type. These are expressed using the Move language. Once a transaction is finalized, its effects - namely changes to the assets it operates on or new assets created - will be persisted, and the resulting assets will be available for further processing. The Sui system operates through a protocol between a set of independent validators. Yet all its security properties are preserved when a small subset of the validators do not follow the protocol. All operations in Sui can be audited to ensure any assets have been correctly processed. This implies all operations on Sui are visible to all, and users may wish to use multiple different addresses to protect their privacy. Validators are determined periodically through users of Sui locking and delegating SUI tokens to one or more validators. Security architecture The Sui system is operated by a set of validators that process transactions. They implement the Sui protocol that allows them to reach agreement on valid transactions submitted and processed in the system. The agreement protocols Sui uses tolerate a fraction of validators not following the Sui protocol correctly, through the use of Byzantine fault tolerant broadcast and consensus. Specifically, each validator has some voting power, assigned to it through the process of users staking / voting for them using their SUI tokens. Sui maintains all its security properties if over 2/3 of the stake is assigned to validators that follow the protocol. However, a number of auditing properties are maintained even if more validators are faulty. Addresses and ownership A Sui transaction is valid and can proceed only if the owner of all owned assets it operates on digitally signs it with their private signature key. This signature key can be kept private by the user and not be shared with anyone else. As a result, it is not feasible for any other party to operate on an owned asset of a user undetected, even if all validators do not follow the protocol. A private signature key also corresponds to a public address on the Sui network that can be used to send a user assets or allow smart contracts to define custom access control logic. A user may have one or more addresses corresponding to multiple signature keys for convenience or privacy reasons. An address does not need any pre-registration, and sending an asset to an address automatically creates this address on the network. However, this means that users should be careful to check the recipient address of transfers, or parties involved in any other operations, as sending assets to an incorrect address may have irrevocable effects. Smart contracts define asset types and their logic All assets have a type that is defined within a Sui Smart Contract. Sui provides a few system contracts, such as these used to manage the SUI native token, yet also allows anyone to write and submit custom smart contracts. A transaction on an asset type can call operations defined in only the smart contract that defined the asset type, and is constrained by the logic in the contract. For this reason, users are encouraged to operate on their assets using smart contracts they trust, that they or others they trust have audited, and understand the logic they define for operations on their assets. Sui smart contracts are defined as immutable assets to allow third parties to audit them and also prevent their modification to increase assurance. The Sui Move smart contract language is designed with ease of audit and verification in mind. You may be interested in our introduction to Smart Contracts in Move. Shared assets allow multiple users to operate on them through transactions; that may include some of their owned assets as well as one or more shared assets. These shared assets represent data and logic used to implement protocols that mediate between different users in a safe way, according to the smart contract that defined the type of the shared asset. Sui allows all users to create transactions involving shared assets. But the smart contract type may define additional restrictions on which address and how the shared assets may be used. Transaction finality A valid transaction submitted to all validators has to be certified and its certificate also has to be submitted to all validators to be finalized. Even if a subset of validators do not follow the protocol, the transaction can be finalized through the remaining validators that correctly follow the Sui protocol. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic Byzantine fault tolerant agreement protocols for broadcast and consensus defined by the Sui protocol. These protocols ensure both safety, meaning that the incorrect validators cannot convince correct clients of incorrect state, and liveness, meaning that incorrect validators cannot prevent transaction processing. All transactions in Sui have to be associated with a gas asset to cover the cost of processing by Sui. A valid transaction may result in successful execution or an aborted execution. An execution may abort due to a condition within the smart contract defining the asset, or because it has ran out of sufficient gas to pay for the cost of execution. In cases of success, the effects of the operation will be finalized; otherwise, the state of assets in the transaction is not changed. However, the gas asset is always charged some amount of gas, to alleviate denial-of-service attacks on the system as a whole. A user client can perform the process of submitting the transaction and certificate itself or rely on third party services to submit the transaction and interact with validators. Such third parties need not have user private signature keys and cannot forge transactions on the users' behalf. They can reassure a user client a transaction has been finalized through a set of signatures from validators attesting to the transactions finality and its effects. After that point, the users can be assured that changes the transaction resulted in will persist on the state of Sui. Auditing and privacy Sui validators provide facilities for users to read all assets they store, as well as the historical record of transactions they have processed that led to these assets. Validators also provide cryptographic evidence of the full chain of transactions that contributed to an asset state. User clients can request and validate this chain of evidence to ensure all operations were correct and the result of the collective agreement between validators. Services that operate full replicas, mirroring the state of one or more validators, perform such audits routinely. The public auditability of Sui also implies that all transactions and assets within Sui are publicly visible. Users that are mindful of their privacy may use multiple addresses to benefit from some degree of pseudonymity, or third-party custodial or non-custodial services. Specific smart contracts with additional cryptographic privacy protections can also be provided by third parties. Censorship-resistance and openness Sui uses the established Delegated Proof-of Stake model to periodically determine its set of validators. Users can lock and delegate their SUI tokens in each epoch to determine the committee of validators that operate the Sui network in the next epoch. Anyone with over a minimum amount of delegated stake can operate a Sui validator. Validators operate the network and provide rewards to users that stake their Sui to support them as validators, through gas fee income. Validators with poor reliability, and in turn the users that delegated their stake to them, may receive a lower reward. But user stake cannot be confiscated away either by malicious validators or anyone in the network. This mechanism ensures that validators are accountable to Sui users and can be rotated out at the first sign of unreliability or misbehavior, including noticed attempts to censor valid transactions. Through choices of validators, and the protocol they are willing to operate, Sui users also have a meaningful say on the future evolution of the Sui system.

Use one of the on-chain networks to experiment with the version of Sui running on that network. You can also spin up a local Sui network for local development. The Sui networks consist of: Four validator nodes operated by Mysten Labs. Clients send transactions and read requests via this endpoint: https://fullnode.<SUI-NETWORK-VERSION>.sui.io:443 using JSON-RPC. A public network Sui Explorer for browsing transaction history. You can request test SUI tokens through the Sui devnet-faucet and testnet-faucet Discord channels, depending on which version of the network you're working with. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your local faucet. The coins on these networks have no financial value. With each Sui release, the network resets and removes all assets (coins and NFTs). See announcements about Sui Devnet in the #devnet-updates Discord channel. See the terms of service for using Sui networks. Tools Sui provides the following tools to interact with Sui networks: Sui command line interface (CLI) Create and manage your private keys Create example NFTs Call and publish Move modules Sui Explorer to view transactions and objects on the network Environment set up First, Install Sui. After you install Sui, request SUI test tokens through Discord for the network you are using: Devnet or Testnet. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your local faucet. To check whether Sui is already installed, run the following command: which\ssui\n If Sui is installed, the command returns the path to the Sui binary. If Sui is not installed, it returns sui\snot\sfound. See the Sui Releases page to view the changes in each Sui release. Configure Sui client If you previously ran sui\sgenesis to create a local network, it created a Sui client configuration file (client.yaml) that connects to localhost at http://0.0.0.0:9000. See Connect to custom RPC endpoint to update the client.yaml file. To connect the Sui client to a network, run the following command: sui\sclient\n If you receive the sui-client help output in the console, you already have a client.yaml file. See Connect to custom RPC endpoint to add a new environment alias or to switch the currently active network. The first time you start Sui client without having a client.yaml file, the console displays the following message: Config\sfile\s["<PATH-TO-FILE>/client.yaml"]\sdoesn't\sexist,\sdo\syou\swant\sto\sconnect\sto\sa\sSui\sFull\snode\sserver\s[y/N]?\n Press y and then press Enter. The process then requests the RPC server URL: Sui\sFull\snode\sserver\sURL\s(Defaults\sto\sSui\sDevnet\sif\snot\sspecified)\s:\n Press Enter to connect to Sui Devnet. To use a custom RPC server or Sui Testnet, enter the URL to the correct RPC endpoint and then press Enter. If you enter a URL, the process prompts for an alias for the environment: Environment\salias\sfor\s[<URL-ENTERED>]\s:\n Type an alias name and press Enter. Select\skey\sscheme\sto\sgenerate\skeypair\s(0\sfor\sed25519,\s1\sfor\ssecp256k1,\s2\sfor\ssecp256r1):\n Press 0, 1, or 2 to select a key scheme and the press Enter. Sui returns a message similar to the following (depending on the key scheme you selected) that includes the address and 24-word recovery phrase for the address: Generated\snew\skeypair\sfor\saddress\swith\sscheme\s"ed25519"\s[0xb9c83a8b40d3263c9ba40d551514fbac1f8c12e98a4005a0dac072d3549c2442]\nSecret\sRecovery\sPhrase\s:\s[cap\swheat\smany\sline\shuman\slazy\sfew\ssolid\sbored\sproud\sspeed\sgrocery\sraise\serode\sthere\sidea\sinform\sculture\scousin\sshed\ssniff\sauthor\sspare\scarpet]\n Connect to a custom RPC endpoint If you previously used sui\sgenesis with the force option (-f or --force), your client.yaml file already includes two RPC endpoints: localnet at http://0.0.0.0:9000 and devnet at https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443. You can view the defined environments with the sui\sclient\senvs command, and switch between them with the sui\sclient\sswitch command. If you previously installed a Sui client that connected to a Sui network, or created a local network, you can modify your existing client.yaml file to change the configured RPC endpoint. The sui\sclient commands that relate to environments read from and write to the client.yaml file. To check currently available environment aliases, run the following command: sui\sclient\senvs\n The command outputs the available environment aliases, with (active) denoting the currently active network. localnet\s=>\shttp://0.0.0.0:9000\s(active)\ndevnet\s=>\shttps://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443\n To add a new alias for a custom RPC endpoint, run the following command. Replace values in < > with values for your installation: sui\sclient\snew-env\s--alias\s<ALIAS>\s--rpc\s<RPC-SERVER-URL>\n To switch the active network, run the following command: sui\sclient\sswitch\s--env\s<ALIAS>\n If you encounter an issue, delete the Sui configuration directory (~/.sui/sui_config) and reinstall the latest Sui binaries. Validating In the following sections, the object IDs, addresses, and authority signatures used are example values only. Sui generates unique values for each of these, so you see different values when you run the commands. Request test tokens Join Discord. If you try to join the Sui Discord channel using a newly created Discord account you may need to wait a few days for validation. Get your Sui client address: sui\sclient\sactive-address Request test SUI tokens in the Sui #devnet-faucet or #testnet-faucet Discord channel. Send the following message to the relevant channel with your client address: !faucet\s<YOUR-CLIENT-ADDRESS>. If you have a local network, programmatically request tokens from your local faucet. Publish a Move module This section describes how to publish a sample Move package using code developed in the Sui Move tutorial. The instructions assume that you installed Sui in the default location. sui\sclient\spublish\s<your-sui-repo>/sui_programmability/examples/move_tutorial\s--gas-budget\s30000\n The response resembles

The package publish operation creates several objects: A package object (with ID 0x0c1c...305a in the example output). A Forge object (with ID 0xa8e0...d0a9 in the example output) as a result of running a module initializer for the one (and only) module of this package. An UpgradeCap object (with ID 0x72ba...a860 in the example output) for use in future package upgrades. You can check the details of each object using the sui\sclient\sobject\s<OBJECT-ID> command or by using the Sui Explorer. When you publish a package, the IDs for the objects the compiler creates are different than the ones displayed in this example. The remainder of this topic uses <PACKAGE-ID> and <FORGE-ID> to represent the IDs for the created objects (except for console output examples). You must replace these with the values for your package. Make a Move call This section describes how to call into functions defined in the package published in the previous section. Use the (<PACKAGE-ID>) and (<FORGE-ID>) values from your package to create swords and transfer them to other players. To demonstrate this, <PLAYER-ADDRESS> represents the address of the player to receive a sword. You can use an address of someone you know, or create another address for testing with the following Sui Client CLI command: sui\sclient\snew-address\sed25519\n The command returns the following message and a 24-word recovery phrase for the address: Created\snew\skeypair\sfor\saddress\swith\sscheme\sED25519:\s[0xa01cd0c520f12a1e9d57bf3cc6ea0f8cf93e81e9fe46f7b4916c310a809dfddd]\nSecret\sRecovery\sPhrase\s:\s[sunny\stip\selement\ssalad\sfrequent\sfebruary\samount\snotice\schair\skite\srace\spush\snoise\sketchup\sthat\ssame\scannon\sbench\smirror\splease\sdinosaur\sindicate\sviolin\ssunset]\n To create a sword and transfer it to another player, we use the following command to call the sword_create function in the my_module module of the package we previously published. You must use the same format for the command and function parameters as the example shown.

Shinami handles the management, refueling and optimization of gas (SUI) to facilitate sponsored transactions. This frees apps to focus on how to apply sponsored transactions to improve onboarding and user engagement. Check out our gas station guide and TypeScript tutorial for more details on how it works. This section details the JSON-RPC methods for interacting with Shinami's gas station. gas_sponsorTransactionBlock Description Sponsors a gasless transaction by attaching a gas object to it and signs the sponsored transaction with the gas owner's key.

SUI Token Community Access Program DocumentationValidatorsSubscribe to our newsletter. Get news, updates, and insights. BuildUse CasesResearchBlogSubscribe to our newsletter. Get news, updates, and insights. LearnEcosystem DirectorySui AmbassadorsSubscribe to our newsletter. Get news, updates, and insights. ConnectStart BuildingStart BuildingSUI Token Community Access ProgramThe SUI Token Community Access Program enables Sui community members to obtain SUI tokens in the early phases of the network's life.Please note US citizens and/or residents are ineligible to receive SUI as part of the Community Access Program.The Sui Foundation has always stated clearly that there will not be any airdrops of SUI. Below we outline the various ways SUI has been allocated within this program.Retrospective Awards and a Recognition Sale for Sui Champions & SupportersOpen to select participants in the development of Sui to dateThis group is comprised of participants in the Sui ecosystem, who have supported the network since inception through meaningful contributions. These participants have operated as testers, community managers, contributors, builders and much more. Sui would not be where it is without these participants and it is critical they are recognized for their efforts. Eligible recipients are as follows:1. Competition Winners from Capy HolidaysAs part of the Capy Holidays competition run during the Wave 1 testing round, a number of winners were selected via voting on social media. Winners have been contacted directly and will receive tokens in line with the stated competition terms.2. ChampionsThis group has been identified based on their direct actions and contributions to support the network. Recipients in this group have taken on roles as testers and moderators, they have attended Builder Houses and key events, sometimes helping to organize and run them. But no matter the role they have filled or task they have completed, they have all demonstrated their passion for Sui by contributing significant time and effort.‍This group will receive a grant of SUI after the network hits mainnet. Recipients will be contacted directly and will be able to access their tokens at a future date.3. SupportersThis category is reserved for the dedicated Sui Discord community who have joined what we fondly call the “Suinami”, offering suggestions, participating in discussions, interacting with ecosystem projects, and advocating for technical innovations. ‍This cohort includes participants who joined the community before February 1, 2023.‍It also includes our Frenemies Competition Winners who will receive direct communication on how to purchase SUI in the Recognition Sale. Supporters on Discord have been notified via community channels about how to verify their eligibility. Information has been published in open channels only. Once their tenure on the server is confirmed, they will receive further instructions on how to make their purchase. Interested purchasers must complete account registration and verification with the applicable exchange by April 24, 2023.General Sale via Select ExchangesOpen to the publicThe SUI token will be available for general purchase via KuCoin and OKX, subject to the following conditions: Not available to US citizens and/or residents.Exchange terms and conditions apply, including know-your-customer and sanctions checks, and any restrictions on providing services to persons located in certain countries. A minimum account balance established by exchanges may apply.Interested purchasers must complete account registration and verification with the applicable exchange by April 24, 2023.Purchase and transfer limits apply. For more information, please visit the exchanges directly to learn about the sale.Aiming for SuccessAs any World Cup team knows, the road to success lies between clearly defined goal posts. The Sui Foundation’s SUI Token Community Access Program is no different, and has been designed with the goal of:Maximizing geographic coverage where permissible: The Sui community is global in reach and, as such, token distribution should permit broad participation across all regions of the world.Empowering robust and fair participation: The aim is to make SUI tokens as broadly accessible as possible, while also recognizing and ensuring access to early Sui contributors and supporters.The Sui Foundation will continue to work on ensuring this program delivers on its goals. In the meantime, drop a line on our Discord channels, apply for a developer grant, and keep learning about Sui.Terms and ConditionsTo be eligible to participate in the Community Access Program you must be of the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence. ‍U.S. citizens and/or residents are ineligible to participate in the Community Access Program. ‍Eligibility for tokens are subject to applicable law, “know your customer,” and sanctions compliance requirements, and may be contingent upon providing certain identifying and related information about you and your organization. Exchange terms and conditions apply to receipt of tokens via an exchange, including any restrictions on providing services to persons located in certain countries. Supply is fixed. Purchase limits may apply.‍Sui Foundation reserves the right to terminate the Community Access Program in whole or in part at any time without prior notice. We may change or modify the amounts of tokens and/or discontinue, or terminate, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of the tokens at any time and without notice, and we may elect not to provide any tokens to any person(s). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to restrict any person(s) from receipt of tokens who we find to be acting in violation of these terms, to be acting in an unethical or disruptive manner or in a manner inconsistent with the values of Sui Foundation, or with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, as we determine in our sole discretion. Participants are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with receipt of any tokens. ‍Participants must provide us with any additional information and complete any required tax or other forms relating to receipt of such tokens.

By choosing to participate, participants agree to be bound by the terms of such privacy policy.Community Access Program FAQWhat is the SUI Token Community Access Program?The SUI Token Community Access Program enables Sui community members to obtain SUI tokens in the early phases of the network's life.How can I get into the SUI Token Community Access Program?The Community Access Program will allow Sui community members and the general public to obtain SUI directly. A retrospective award and a recognition sale will be offered to people who have been instrumental in bringing the Sui network and ecosystem to life, including people who have operated as testers, community managers, contributors, builders, and otherwise supported the Sui community from day 1 until February 1st 2023. In addition, a broader audience is able to purchase the SUI token by registering with one of the participating exchanges. All recipients will need to pass identity verification by the exchanges. The program is not open to US citizens and/or residents.Why are US residents and citizens ineligible?As much as we would like to, US citizens and/or residents are ineligible for this offer at this time.When will I know if I have received an award?If you are in the group being given a retrospective award, you will be contacted directly and invited to register with an exchange to claim your tokens. If you are purchasing tokens in connection with the Recognition Sale, you will be notified by the exchange you registered with if you have been successful in receiving an allocation to purchase.Build BeyondUnlock the freedom to build powerful on-chain assetsDevelopersDocumentationGithubWhitepaperCommunityAmbassador ProgramBlogEcosystem DirectoryEcosystem Job BoardCommunity Access Program©2023 Copyright Sui.

your transactions. If you need a near real-time measurement (within a few seconds), use the immutable reference of time provided by the Clock module in Sui Move. The reference value from this module updates with every network checkpoint. If you don't need as current a time slice, use the epoch_timestamp_ms function to capture the precise moment the current epoch started. The sui::clock::Clock module To access a prompt timestamp, you must pass a read-only reference of sui::clock::Clock as an entry function parameter in your transactions. An instance of Clock is provided at address 0x6, no new instances can be created. Extract a unix timestamp in milliseconds from an instance of Clock using module\ssui::clock\s{\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\stimestamp_ms(clock:\s&Clock):\su64;\n}\n The example below demonstrates an entry function that emits an event containing a timestamp from the Clock: module\sexample::clock\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::clock::{Self,\sClock};\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::event;\n\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sTimeEvent\shas\scopy,\sdrop,\sstore\s{\s\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\stimestamp_ms:\su64\n\s\s\s\s}\n\n\s\s\s\sentry\sfun\saccess(clock:\s&Clock)\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sevent::emit(TimeEvent\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\stimestamp_ms:\sclock::timestamp_ms(clock),\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s});\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n A call to the previous entry function takes the following form, passing 0x6 as the address for the Clock parameter: sui\sclient\scall\s--package\s<EXAMPLE>\s--module\s'clock'\s--function\s'access'\s--args\s'0x6'\s--gas-budget\s10000\n Expect the Clock timestamp to change every 2 to 3 seconds, at the rate the network commits checkpoints. Successive calls to sui::clock::timestamp_ms in the same transaction always produce the same result (transactions are considered to take effect instantly), but timestamps from Clock are otherwise monotonic across transactions that touch the same shared objects: Successive transactions seeing a greater or equal timestamp to their predecessors. Any transaction that requires access to a Clock must go through consensus because the only available instance is a shared object. As a result, this technique is not suitable for transactions that must use the single-owner fast-path (see Epoch timestamps for a single-owner-compatible source of timestamps). Transactions that use the clock must accept it as an immutable reference (not a mutable reference or value). This prevents contention, as transactions that access the Clock can only read it, so do not need to be sequenced relative to each other. Validators refuse to sign transactions that do not meet this requirement and packages that include entry functions that accept a Clock or &mut\sClock fail to publish. The following functions test 'Clock'-dependent code by manually creating (and sharing) a Clock object and incrementing its timestamp. This is possible only in test code: module\ssui::clock\s{\n\s\s\s\s#[test_only]\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\screate_for_testing(ctx:\s&mut\sTxContext);\n\n\s\s\s\s#[test_only]\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sincrement_for_testing(clock:\s&mut\sClock,\stick:\su64);\n}\n The next example presents a simple test that creates a Clock, increments it, and then checks its value: module\sexample::clock_tests\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::clock::{Self,\sClock};\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::test_scenario\sas\sts;\n\n\s\s\s\s#[test]\n\s\s\s\sfun\screating_a_clock_and_incrementing_it()\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\sts\s=\sts::begin(@0x1);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\sctx\s=\sts::ctx(&mut\sts);\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sclock::create_for_testing(ctx);\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\slet\sclock\s=\sts::take_shared<Clock>(&ts);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sclock::increment_for_testing(&mut\sclock,\s20);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sclock::increment_for_testing(&mut\sclock,\s22);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sassert!(clock::timestamp_ms(&clock)\s==\s42,\s0);\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sts::return_shared(clock);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sts::end(ts);\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n\n Epoch timestamps You can use the following function to access the timestamp for the start of the current epoch for all transactions (including ones that do not go through consensus): module\ssui::tx_context\s{\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sepoch_timestamp_ms(ctx:\s&TxContext):\su64;\n}\n The preceding function returns the point in time when the current epoch started, as a millisecond granularity unix timestamp in a u64. This value changes roughly once every 24 hours, when the epoch changes. Tests based on sui::test_scenario can use later_epoch (following code), to exercise time-sensitive code that uses epoch_timestamp_ms (previous code): module\ssui::test_scenario\s{\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\slater_epoch(\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sscenario:\s&mut\sScenario,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sdelta_ms:\su64,\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\ssender:\saddress,\n\s\s\s\s):\sTransactionEffects;\n}\n later_epoch behaves like sui::test_scenario::next_epoch (finishes the current transaction and epoch in the test scenario), but also increments the timestamp by delta_ms milliseconds to simulate the progress of time.

There we describe the Sui Move variant of the Move programming language and explain how to use it to write smart contracts and programming with objects. Instead, this site builds upon the smart contract examples already highlighted with component-by-component examples you may reference at any time. What is more expressive in the world of code than the code itself? In this book, you'll find examples for most of the features of Sui Move as well as a number of advanced patterns that can be used right away to improve your modules. All code samples in this book are written with the assumption that you use Sui Move, which can installed with this command: $\scargo\sinstall\s--locked\s--git\shttps://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git\s--branch\s"main"\ssui\n Keep in mind that the branch is set to main. If you're developing with our devnet, instead follow the instructions to install Sui.

require updates or changes to your app or implementation to continue functioning as expected. This guide provides migration steps to help you make the required updates. It also includes descriptions of some new features included in the release. Sui Move updates The steps in this section provide guidance on making updates related to the changes to Sui Move. Sui Framework split into two Move packages Updated 3/27/23 The Sui Framework (sui-framework) Move package contains modules central to Sui Move, including object, transfer and dynamic_field. The framework package is often a dependency of application packages developed on Sui. Previously, sui-framework included a governance folder that defined a number of modules related to the operations of Sui’s system, such as validator_set and staking_pool. These modules are fundamentally different from the other library modules within the framework, and are not commonly used by developers. To simplify, this release splits sui-framework into two Sui Move packages to improve modularity, usability and upgrading. In PR 9618, the sui-framework crate now contains three Move packages in the packages directory: move-stdlib, sui-framework and sui-system: sui-system contains modules that were in the sui-framework/sources/governance directory, including all the validator management and staking related functions, published at 0x3 with named address sui_system. sui-framework contains all other modules that were not in the governance folder. The framework provides library and utility modules for Sui Move developers. It is still published at 0x2 with named address sui. move-stdlib contains a copy of the Move standard library that used to be in the sui-framework/deps folder. It is still published at 0x1 with named address std. If you develop Sui Move code depending on sui-framework, the Move.toml file of your Move package has to change to reflect the path changes: Prior to this release: [package]\nname\s=\s"Example"\nversion\s=\s"0.0.1"\npublished-at\s=\s"0x42"\n\n[dependencies]\nSui\s=\s{\sgit\s=\s"https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git",\ssubdir="crates/sui-framework/",\srev\s=\s"devnet"\s}\n\n[addresses]\nexample\s=\s"0x42"\n Updated for this release: [package]\nname\s=\s"Example"\nversion\s=\s"0.0.1"\npublished-at\s=\s"0x42"\n\n[dependencies]\nSui\s=\s{\sgit\s=\s"https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git",\ssubdir="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/",\srev\s=\s"devnet"\s}\n\n[addresses]\nexample\s=\s"0x42"\n If your Sui Move code uses a module in the governance folder: genesis.move, sui_system.move, validator_cap.move, voting_power.move, stake_subsidy.move, sui_system_state_inner.move, validator_set.move, staking_pool.move, validator.move, or validator_wrapper.move The modules are now in the sui-system package. You must list SuiSystem as a dependency, and access these modules via 0x3 or the sui_system named address. Erecover and verify In this release, ecdsa_k1::ecrecover and ecdsa_k1::secp256k1_verify now require you to input the raw message instead of a hashed message. ecdsa_k1::ecrecover(sig,\shashed_msg,\shash_function) is updated to ecdsa_k1::secp256k1_ecrecover(sig,\smsg,\shash_function) ecdsa_k1::secp256k1_verify(sig,\spk,\shashed_msg) is updated to ecdsa_k1::secp256k1_verify(sig,\spk,\smsg,\shash_function) When you call these APIs, you must provide the raw message instead of the hashed message for verification or EC recover. You must also provide the hash_function name represented by u8. See the source code for more information: ecdsa_k1.md ecdsa_r1.md ID Leak UIDs must now be statically deemed “fresh” when you construct an object. This means that the UID must come from object::new (or test_scenario::new_object during tests). To migrate an existing project, any function that previously took a UID as an argument to construct an object now requires the TxContext to generate new IDs. For example, prior to release .28, to construct an object: fun\snew(id:\sUID):\sCounter\s{\n\s\s\s\sCounter\s{\sid,\scount:\s0\s}\n}\n With release .28, to construct an object: fun\snew(ctx:\s&mut\sTxContext):\sCounter\s{\n\s\s\s\sCounter\s{\sid:\sobject::new(ctx),\scount:\s0\s}\n}\n Publisher This is not a breaking change, but Publisher is an important addition that can be helpful. The Publisher object requires an OTW and can be claimed in any module within a package via the sui::package::claim call: module\sexample::dummy\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::package;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::tx_context::TxContext;\n\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sDUMMY\shas\sdrop\s{}\n\n\s\s\s\sfun\sinit(otw:\sDUMMY,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext)\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s//\screates\sa\sPublisher\sobject\sand\ssends\sto\sthe\s`sender`\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\spackage::claim_and_keep(otw,\sctx)\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n To learn more about Publisher, see Publisher. Sui Object Display Standard This release includes the Sui Object Display standard, a new way to describe objects of a single type using a set of named templates to standardize their display off-chain. The Sui API also supports the new standard. To read a detailed description and the motivation behind the standard, see the Sui Object Display proposal. In Sui Move, to claim a Display object, call display::new<T>(&Publisher). As stated in the signature, it requires the Publisher object. Once acquired, Display can be modified by adding new fields (templates) to it, and when it’s ready to be published, a display::update_version(&mut\sDisplay) call is required to publish and make it available. All further additions / edits in the Display should also be applied by calling update_version again. Fields that we suggest to use in Display are: name: a displayable name link: a link to an object in an application / external link description: a broader displayable description image_url: an URL or a blob with an image project_url: a link to a website creator: mentions the creator in any way (text, link, address etc) See additional information and examples in Display. API and SDK changes The steps in this section provide guidance on making updates related to the changes to Sui APIs and SDKs. Reading objects The sui_getObject endpoint now takes an additional configuration parameter of type SuiObjectDataOptions to control which fields the endpoint retrieves. By default, the endpoint retrieves only object references unless the client request explicitly specifies other data, such as type, owner, or bcs.

Before this release, the reading process will start from genesis when it hits latest and the None value is not properly handled. Building and executing transaction The previous transaction builder methods on the Signer, and the SignableTransaction interface have been removed, and replaced with a new Transaction builder class. This new transaction builder takes full advantage of Programmable Transactions. //\sConstruct\sa\snew\stransaction:\nconst\stx\s=\snew\sTransaction();\n\n//\sExample\sreplacement\sfor\sa\sSUI\stoken\stransfer:\nconst\s[coin]\s=\stx.splitCoins(tx.gas,\s[tx.pure(1000)]);\ntx.transferObjects([coin],\stx.pure(keypair.getPublicKey().toSuiAddress()));\n\n//\sMerge\sa\slist\sof\scoins\sinto\sa\sprimary\scoin:\ntx.mergeCoin(tx.object("0xcoinA"),\s[\n\s\stx.object("0xcoinB"),\n\s\stx.object("0xcoinC"),\n]);\n\n//\sMake\sa\smove\scall:\ntx.moveCall({\n\s\starget:\s`${packageObjectId}::nft::mint`,\n\s\sarguments:\s[tx.pure("Example\sNFT")],\n});\n\n//\sExecute\sa\stransaction:\nconst\sresult\s=\sawait\ssigner.signAndExecuteTransaction({\stransaction:\stx\s});\n Transaction now support providing a list of gas coins as payment for a transaction. By default, the transaction builder automatically determines the gas budget and coins to use as payment for a transaction. You can also set these values, for example to set your own budget, change the gas price, or do your own gas selection: //\sSet\san\sexplicit\sgas\sprice.\sBy\sdefault,\suses\sthe\scurrent\sreference\sgas\sprice:\ntx.setGasPrice(100);\n//\sChange\sthe\sgas\sbudget\s(in\sSUI).\sBy\sdefault,\sthis\sexecutes\sa\sdry\srun\sand\suses\sthe\sgas\sconsumed\sfrom\sthat\sas\sthe\sbudget.\ntx.setGasBudget(customBudgetDefined);\n//\sSet\sthe\svector\sof\sgas\sobjects\sto\suse\sas\sthe\sgas\spayment.\ntx.setGasPayment([coin1,\scoin2]);\n Staking changes The steps in this section provide guidance on making updates related to the changes to Sui staking. Locked coin staking removed Previously users could stake either their Coin<SUI> or their LockedCoin<SUI> with a validator. This release removes support for staking locked coins so stake functions can now take only Coin<SUI>.

Official page for Language Server Protocol LSP / LSIF Overview Implementations Specification Language Server Protocol The Language Server Protocol (LSP) defines the protocol used between an editor or IDE and a language server that provides language features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references etc. The goal of the Language Server Index Format (LSIF, pronounced like "else if") is to support rich code navigation in development tools or a Web UI without needing a local copy of the source code. Star What is the Language Server Protocol? Adding features like auto complete, go to definition, or documentation on hover for a programming language takes significant effort. Traditionally this work had to be repeated for each development tool, as each tool provides different APIs for implementing the same feature. A Language Server is meant to provide the language-specific smarts and communicate with development tools over a protocol that enables inter-process communication. The idea behind the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is to standardize the protocol for how such servers and development tools communicate. This way, a single Language Server can be re-used in multiple development tools, which in turn can support multiple languages with minimal effort. LSP is a win for both language providers and tooling vendors! CSS code complete in VS Code powered by the CSS LSP Server CSS code complete in Atom powered by the CSS LSP Server CSS code complete in Eclipse IDE powered by the CSS LSP Server PowerShell Hover in VS Code powered by the PowerShell LSP Server Rust code complete in Visual Studio powered by the Rust LSP Server Overview The protocol defines the format of the messages sent using JSON-RPC between the development tool and the language server. LSIF defines a graph format to store information about programming artifacts. Specification The latest version of the LSP specification is version 3.17. There is now also a specification for the upcoming language server index format (LSIF). Implementations The LSP has been implemented for many languages and many development tools are integrating these language servers. Hello from Seattle and Zürich.

Announcing Enhanced Move VSCode Plugin The Sui Blog Sui Foundation Home About Contribute an Article Sui Move Announcing Enhanced Move VSCode Plugin Sui Foundation Jul 5, 2022 4 min Move VSCode plugin now ships with many more cool features. Over the last few months, Mysten Labs has been working hard on new features for the Move language’s VSCode plugin (a plugin for the Visual Studio Code editor). And we are now finally ready to share what we have accomplished with the wider developer community. The plugin is intended to work both with the core Move language and with all existing Move language flavors such as Sui Move.The VSCode plugin for Move is called move-analyzer and it is available in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The new features are supported via the Language Server Protocol; in order to unleash the full potential of the plugin, in addition to installing the plugin itself, you also need to install move-analyzer’s language server as described in installation instructions provided with the plugin distribution.The Language Server Protocol (LSP) was originally introduced by Microsoft, but it is also supported by a range of other code editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Sublime Text or Eclipse. It is a standard protocol where an editor of an IDE can “ask” the language server for certain types of information concerning the code being edited. And it lets you visualize data obtained in a way that both enhances and simplifies the code development process. We hope to integrate these new features with other editors of IDEs, ideally with the help of the Move language community.The new features provided by the current version of move-analyzer’s language server fall into two main categories: code comprehension and error reporting. They have been implemented by integrating the language server with the “standard” Move compiler (the compiler that was co-developed with the language and is part of the main Move source code repository). This integration not only guarantees accuracy of the information provided by the language server (e.g., error messages visualized by an editor or an IDE will directly correspond to error messages generated by the compiler), but it will also simplify the language server maintenance in the face of potential future Move language changes. You will find the description of the new features below, and you can also view a demo of the new features in this video:Code comprehensionOne of the problems with more traditional smart contract languages that the Move language design is trying to solve is code composition and reuse. To enable code reuse, the code can be grouped into packages (e.g., a standard library package), and these packages can be shared across different smart contract implementations. This means that developers writing new smart contracts may have to deal with a code base that is largely unknown to them.The new VSCode plugin delivers a set of features that can aid developers in better understanding their entire code base.Type on hoverWhen encountering an identifier in an unknown code base, you may not know the type of the identifier. If you hover a cursor over the name of an identifier (e.g., a name of a local variable or a name of a function), you will see the name of this identifier displayed in a tooltip. See this example.Go to definitionAnother piece of information about an identifier that may not be immediately obvious is where this identifier is defined - it may just as well be a local variable defined in the same function but also, for example, a function defined in a different module. If you right-click on the identifier name and choose the Go to Definition option from the menu, your cursor will be transported to the location of the identifier’s definition. See this example.Go to type definitionEven if you know where the definition of a given identifier is, and you know the name of its type, it does not necessarily mean that it is trivial to locate its type definition. For example, you may already know that the identifier type is struct SomeStruct but you will still not know what are the fields of this struct. If you right-click on the identifier name and choose the Go to Type Definition option from the menu, your cursor will be transported to where the type of this identifier is defined. See this example.Find referencesThe latest feature enhancing code comprehension is the ability to find all occurrences of a given identifier in the entire code base. This can be useful, for example, if you would like to know where a given function is being called. If you right-click on the identifier name and choose the Find All References option from the menu, all occurrences of this identifier will be displayed in the left pane of the VSCode editor window. See this example.Error reportingA standard method of obtaining compiler diagnostics (errors but also warnings) for a piece of Move code is to run the compiler on the command line and observe the output it produces. While this method is certainly sufficient, it may not be the most convenient. Instead, what we introduce in the new version of the VSCode plugin is displaying compiler diagnostics in the editor window. Whenever you save a file, the language server will run the compiler in the background and send the resulting output back to VSCode to be displayed (information concerning code comprehension is also recomputed at the same time). See this example.. . .

Additional Resources Light (default) Rust Coal Navy Ayu Sui Move by Example Object Display A creator or a builder who owns a Publisher object can use the sui::display module to define display properties for their objects. To get a Publisher object check out the Publisher page. Display<T> is an object that specifies a set of named templates for the type T (for example, for a type 0x2::capy::Capy the display would be Display<0x2::capy::Capy>). All objects of the type T will be processed in the Sui Full Node RPC through the matching Display definition and will have processed result attached when an object is queried. Description Sui Object Display is a template engine which allows for on-chain display configuration for type to be handled off-chain by the ecosystem. It has the ability to use an object's data for substitution into a template string. There's no limitation to what fields can be set, all object properties can be accessed via the {property} syntax and inserted as a part of the template string (see examples for the illustration). Example For the following Hero module, the Display would vary based on the "name", "id" and "image_url" properties of the type "Hero". The template defined in the init function can be represented as: {\n\s\s\s\s"name":\s"{name}",\n\s\s\s\s"link":\s"https://sui-heroes.io/hero/{id}",\n\s\s\s\s"image_url":\s"ipfs://{img_url}",\n\s\s\s\s"description":\s"A\strue\sHero\sof\sthe\sSui\secosystem!",\n\s\s\s\s"project_url":\s"https://sui-heroes.io",\n\s\s\s\s"creator":\s"Unknown\sSui\sFan"\n}\n

There we describe the Sui Move variant of the Move programming language and explain how to use it to write smart contracts and programming with objects. Instead, this site builds upon the smart contract examples already highlighted with component-by-component examples you may reference at any time. What is more expressive in the world of code than the code itself? In this book, you'll find examples for most of the features of Sui Move as well as a number of advanced patterns that can be used right away to improve your modules. All code samples in this book are written with the assumption that you use Sui Move, which can installed with this command: $\scargo\sinstall\s--locked\s--git\shttps://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git\s--branch\s"main"\ssui\n Keep in mind that the branch is set to main. If you're developing with our devnet, instead follow the instructions to install Sui.

including staking, reference gas price, and tallying rules. Requirements to run a validator on Sui To run a Sui Validator, you must set up and configure a Sui Validator node. After you have a running node, you must have a minimum of 30 Million SUI in your staking pool to join the Validator set on the Sui network. To learn how to set up and configure a Sui Validator node, see Sui for Node Operators. The guide includes all of the information you need to configure your Validator node. It also provides guidance on the tasks you must perform after you join the validator set. Specific steps you must take include: Install and configure Sui Configure Port and Protocol settings Key management Storage configuration Software updates On-chain commands Update the Gas Price Survey Reporting other validators Validator staking pool requirements After you successfully join the validator set, you must maintain a staking pool with a minimum of 20 Million SUI staked. If, at any point, your staking pool falls below 15 Million SUI, your Validator node is removed from the committee at the next epoch boundary. Sui uses 24-hour epochs. Validator consensus and voting power The total voting power on Sui is always 10,000, regardless of the amount staked. Therefore, the quorum threshold is 6,667. There is no limit to the amount of SUI users can stake with a validator. Each validator has consensus voting power proportional to SUI in its staking pool, with one exception: the voting power of an individual validator is capped at 1,000 (10% of the total). If a validator accumulates more than 10% of total stake, the validator’s voting power remains fixed at 10%, and the remaining voting power is spread across the rest of the validator set. Validator staking pool Each Sui validator maintains its own staking pool to track the amount of stake and to compound staking rewards. Validator pools operate together with a time series of exchange rates that are computed at each epoch boundary. These exchange rates determine the amount of SUI tokens that each past SUI staker can withdraw in the future. Importantly, the exchange rates increase as more rewards are deposited into a staking pool and the longer an amount of SUI is deposited in a staking pool, the more rewards it will accrue. When SUI is deposited to the staking pool in epoch E, those SUI are converted into liquidity tokens at the epoch E exchange rate. As the staking pool earns rewards, the exchange rate appreciates. At epoch E’, those liquidity tokens are worth more and translate into more SUI. The only difference between Sui staking pools and typical liquidity pools is that in Sui the liquidity tokens do not exist. Rather, the global exchange rate table is used to track the accounting. A nice feature of this design is that because all SUI tokens in the staking pool are treated the same, regardless of whether they were originally deposited as new stake or as stake rewards, all SUI tokens immediately count as stake and thus compound rewards immediately. The staking pool is implemented in a system-level smart contract (staking_pool.move) and is part of the Sui Framework. User staking and withdrawals When users stake SUI tokens, these SUI objects are wrapped into StakedSUI objects. The calculation to determine each user’s relative ownership of the staking pool is done directly with the timestamp of the StakedSUI object (which determines the moment at which the deposit took place) and the change in the exchange rates between the deposit epoch and the withdrawal epoch. Each staking pool’s data structure contains a time series with that pool’s exchange rates. These exchange rates can be used to determine the withdrawals of any of the pool’s stakers. Stake withdrawals are processed immediately with the exchange rate prevailing at the previous epoch’s exchange rate. Withdrawals do not have to wait for the current epoch to close. Withdrawals include both the original stake the user deposited and all the stake rewards accumulated up to the previous epoch. Stakers do not earn the rewards accruing to their stake during the epoch at which they withdraw. Since there is no way to know how many stake rewards will be accumulated during the current epoch until the epoch closes, these cannot be included in the withdrawal. Hence, any user can withdraw their stake immediately and receive: SUI withdrawn at E’ = ( SUI deposited at E ) * ( Exchange Rate at E’-1 / Exchange Rate at E ) Validator pool exchange rate The exchange rate for each validator pool is calculated at each epoch boundary as follows: *Exchange Rate at E+1 = ( 1 + ( Third-Party Staker Rewards at E / Third-Party Stake at E ) ) ( Exchange Rate at E ) The distinction between third-party owned vs validator-owned rewards and stake is relevant in that validators earn commissions on the staking pool’s tokens but third-party stakers do not. This accounting enables Sui to keep track of the rewards accrued by both validators and third-party token holders using a single global exchange rate table. Find the exchange rate Each epoch change emits a 0x2::validator_set::ValidatorEpochInfo event per validator with the exchange rate information. You can use the Events API to query events. Staking rewards Within a given validator staking pool, all stakers receive the same proportion of rewards through the pool’s exchange rate appreciation. In addition, since validators earn commissions over the stake they manage, validators receive additional StakedSUI objects at the end of each epoch in proportion to the amount of commissions their staking pool earns. Staking rewards are funded by transaction gas fees collected during the current epoch and by stake subsidies released at the end of the epoch. StakeRewards = StakeSubsidies + GasFees Stake subsidies are intended to subsidize the network during its early phases and are funded by a 10% allocation of SUI tokens. After this allocation depletes, the entirety of stake rewards will be made up of gas fees collected through regular network operations. Stake rewards are made up of gas fees and stake subsidies. The total amount distributed throughout each epoch is determined as follows: Stake Subsidies: The amount distributed in each epoch is determined prior to the beginning of the epoch according to a predefined schedule. Gas Fees: Each epoch’s amount depends on the total gas fees collected throughout the epoch. Each Sui transaction pays gas fees depending on two variables, the amount of executed gas units and the gas price: GasFee = GasPrice * GasUnits The total amount of gas fees collected corresponds to the sum of gas fees across all transactions processed in the epoch. During regular market conditions, the vast majority of transactions should have a GasPrice equal to the ReferenceGasPrice. User staking and rewards A stake deposit request goes into a pending state immediately in the staking pool as soon as it is made. Sui Wallet reflects any pending stake deposit requests for the user’s account. However, pending stake deposit requests do not take effect until the end of the epoch during which the request is made. A withdrawal (un-stake) request is processed immediately as soon as it is received. The staker obtains the originally deposited SUI together with all accrued stake rewards up to the previous epoch boundary – in other words, they do not include stake rewards for the current epoch. Users can’t withdraw a portion of their active stake. They must withdraw all staked SUI at the same time. Users can, however, stake using multiple StakedSui objects by splitting their SUI into multiple coins. They can then perform a partial withdrawal from a validator by un-staking only some of the StakedSUI objects. Reference gas price Sui is designed such that end-users can expect the gas price to be stable and predictable during regular network operations. This is achieved by having validators set the network’s reference gas price at the beginning of each epoch. Operationally this is achieved through a Gas Price Survey that occurs as follows: During each epoch E, each validator submits what they think the optimal reference gas price should be for the next epoch E+1. At the epoch boundary, when Sui transitions from epoch E to epoch E+1, the network observes the gas price quotes across the validator set and sets the 2/3 percentile weighted by stake as the epoch’s reference gas price. Hence the reference gas price is constant throughout each epoch and is only updated when the epoch changes. For example, assume that there are seven validators with equal stake, and the price quotes they submit are {15, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 23}. The protocol sets the reference gas price at 8. In practice, the process for submitting a gas price quote for the Gas Price Survey is a straightforward one. Each validator owns an object that contains their quote for the reference gas price. To change their response, they must update the value in that object. For example, to set the price quote for the next epoch to 42, run: sui\sclient\scall\s--package\s0x2\s--module\ssui_system\s--function\srequest_set_gas_price\s--args\s0x5\s\"42\"\s--gas-budget\s1000\n Importantly, the gas object’s value persists across epochs so that a validator who does not update and submit a new quote uses the same quote from the previous epoch. Hence, a validator seeking to optimize its own operations should update its quote every epoch in response to changes in network operations and market conditions. Validator slashing and tallying rule Sui is designed to encourage and enforce community monitoring of the validator set. This is done through the Tallying Rule by which each validator monitors and scores every other validator in order to ensure that everyone is operating efficiently and in the network’s best interest. Validators that receive a low score can be penalized with slashed stake rewards. The protocol only computes the global Tallying Rule score at the epoch boundary and so relies on validators monitoring actively and changing their individual scores whenever they detect changes in other validator behavior. In general, the Tallying Rule default option should always be a score of one for all validators and only be changed to zero upon determining bad operations. In practice, the Tallying Rule consists of a set of objects each validator owns that default to scores of one and thus a validator will generally be passive and only update the object corresponding to another validator’s score whenever needed. For example, to report a validator whose Sui address is 0x44840a79dd5cf1f5efeff1379f5eece04c72db13512a2e31e8750f5176285446 as bad or non-performant, run: sui\sclient\scall\s--package\s0x2\s--module\ssui_system\s--function\sreport_validator\s--args\s0x5\s0x44840a79dd5cf1f5efeff1379f5eece04c72db13512a2e31e8750f5176285446\s--gas-budget\s1000\n The Tallying Rule should be implemented through a social equilibrium. The validator set should actively monitor itself and if one validator is clearly non-performant, then the other validators should score that validator with a 0 and slash its rewards. Community members can launch public dashboards tracking validator performance and that can be used as further signal into a validator’s operations. There is no limit on the number of validators that can receive a 0 tallying score in an epoch.

Each staking pool’s data structure contains a time series with that pool’s exchange rates. These exchange rates can be used to determine the withdrawals of any of the pool’s stakers. Stake withdrawals are processed immediately with the exchange rate prevailing at the previous epoch’s exchange rate. Withdrawals do not have to wait for the current epoch to close. Withdrawals include both the original stake the user deposited and all the stake rewards accumulated up to the previous epoch. Stakers do not earn the rewards accruing to their stake during the epoch at which they withdraw. Since there is no way to know how many stake rewards will be accumulated during the current epoch until the epoch closes, these cannot be included in the withdrawal. Hence, any user can withdraw their stake immediately and receive: SUI withdrawn at E’ = ( SUI deposited at E ) * ( Exchange Rate at E’-1 / Exchange Rate at E ) Validator pool exchange rate The exchange rate for each validator pool is calculated at each epoch boundary as follows: *Exchange Rate at E+1 = ( 1 + ( Third-Party Staker Rewards at E / Third-Party Stake at E ) ) ( Exchange Rate at E ) The distinction between third-party owned vs validator-owned rewards and stake is relevant in that validators earn commissions on the staking pool’s tokens but third-party stakers do not. This accounting enables Sui to keep track of the rewards accrued by both validators and third-party token holders using a single global exchange rate table. Find the exchange rate Each epoch change emits a 0x2::validator_set::ValidatorEpochInfo event per validator with the exchange rate information. You can use the Events API to query events. Staking rewards Within a given validator staking pool, all stakers receive the same proportion of rewards through the pool’s exchange rate appreciation. In addition, since validators earn commissions over the stake they manage, validators receive additional StakedSUI objects at the end of each epoch in proportion to the amount of commissions their staking pool earns. Staking rewards are funded by transaction gas fees collected during the current epoch and by stake subsidies released at the end of the epoch. StakeRewards = StakeSubsidies + GasFees Stake subsidies are intended to subsidize the network during its early phases and are funded by a 10% allocation of SUI tokens. After this allocation depletes, the entirety of stake rewards will be made up of gas fees collected through regular network operations. Stake rewards are made up of gas fees and stake subsidies. The total amount distributed throughout each epoch is determined as follows: Stake Subsidies: The amount distributed in each epoch is determined prior to the beginning of the epoch according to a predefined schedule. Gas Fees: Each epoch’s amount depends on the total gas fees collected throughout the epoch. Each Sui transaction pays gas fees depending on two variables, the amount of executed gas units and the gas price: GasFee = GasPrice * GasUnits The total amount of gas fees collected corresponds to the sum of gas fees across all transactions processed in the epoch. During regular market conditions, the vast majority of transactions should have a GasPrice equal to the ReferenceGasPrice. User staking and rewards A stake deposit request goes into a pending state immediately in the staking pool as soon as it is made. Sui Wallet reflects any pending stake deposit requests for the user’s account. However, pending stake deposit requests do not take effect until the end of the epoch during which the request is made. A withdrawal (un-stake) request is processed immediately as soon as it is received. The staker obtains the originally deposited SUI together with all accrued stake rewards up to the previous epoch boundary – in other words, they do not include stake rewards for the current epoch. Users can’t withdraw a portion of their active stake. They must withdraw all staked SUI at the same time. Users can, however, stake using multiple StakedSui objects by splitting their SUI into multiple coins. They can then perform a partial withdrawal from a validator by un-staking only some of the StakedSUI objects. Reference gas price Sui is designed such that end-users can expect the gas price to be stable and predictable during regular network operations. This is achieved by having validators set the network’s reference gas price at the beginning of each epoch. Operationally this is achieved through a Gas Price Survey that occurs as follows: During each epoch E, each validator submits what they think the optimal reference gas price should be for the next epoch E+1. At the epoch boundary, when Sui transitions from epoch E to epoch E+1, the network observes the gas price quotes across the validator set and sets the 2/3 percentile weighted by stake as the epoch’s reference gas price. Hence the reference gas price is constant throughout each epoch and is only updated when the epoch changes. For example, assume that there are seven validators with equal stake, and the price quotes they submit are {15, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 23}. The protocol sets the reference gas price at 8. In practice, the process for submitting a gas price quote for the Gas Price Survey is a straightforward one. Each validator owns an object that contains their quote for the reference gas price. To change their response, they must update the value in that object. For example, to set the price quote for the next epoch to 42, run: sui\sclient\scall\s--package\s0x2\s--module\ssui_system\s--function\srequest_set_gas_price\s--args\s0x5\s\"42\"\s--gas-budget\s1000\n Importantly, the gas object’s value persists across epochs so that a validator who does not update and submit a new quote uses the same quote from the previous epoch. Hence, a validator seeking to optimize its own operations should update its quote every epoch in response to changes in network operations and market conditions. Validator slashing and tallying rule Sui is designed to encourage and enforce community monitoring of the validator set. This is done through the Tallying Rule by which each validator monitors and scores every other validator in order to ensure that everyone is operating efficiently and in the network’s best interest. Validators that receive a low score can be penalized with slashed stake rewards. The protocol only computes the global Tallying Rule score at the epoch boundary and so relies on validators monitoring actively and changing their individual scores whenever they detect changes in other validator behavior. In general, the Tallying Rule default option should always be a score of one for all validators and only be changed to zero upon determining bad operations. In practice, the Tallying Rule consists of a set of objects each validator owns that default to scores of one and thus a validator will generally be passive and only update the object corresponding to another validator’s score whenever needed. For example, to report a validator whose Sui address is 0x44840a79dd5cf1f5efeff1379f5eece04c72db13512a2e31e8750f5176285446 as bad or non-performant, run: sui\sclient\scall\s--package\s0x2\s--module\ssui_system\s--function\sreport_validator\s--args\s0x5\s0x44840a79dd5cf1f5efeff1379f5eece04c72db13512a2e31e8750f5176285446\s--gas-budget\s1000\n The Tallying Rule should be implemented through a social equilibrium. The validator set should actively monitor itself and if one validator is clearly non-performant, then the other validators should score that validator with a 0 and slash its rewards. Community members can launch public dashboards tracking validator performance and that can be used as further signal into a validator’s operations. There is no limit on the number of validators that can receive a 0 tallying score in an epoch.

changes to Sui, and to prepare for the next Sui release to the Devnet or Testnet network. To set up a local network, Sui provides the sui-test-validator binary. The sui-test-validator starts a local network that includes a Sui Full node, a Sui validator, and a Sui faucet. You can use the included faucet to get test SUI to use on the local network. Prerequisites Install the necessary prerequisites for Sui. Install Sui Use the steps in this section to install the sui-test-validator to run a local network. To install Sui to build or for other purposes, use the steps in the Install Sui topic. If you previously installed Sui, do one of the following: Use the same branch for the commands in this topic that you used to install Sui Install Sui again using the branch you intend to use for your local network You have two options to install Sui: Clone the Sui GitHub repository locally, and then install Sui from your local drive Install Sui directly from the remote Sui repository. If you clone the repository and install Sui from your local drive, you can also start a local Sui Explorer and Sui Wallet that works with your local network. When you install sui-test-validator but don't have libpq installed, you might see the following message: ld:\slibrary\snot\sfound\sfor\s-lpq To resolve this, use Brew to install libpq with the following command: brew\sinstall\slibpq\n Also add the path to your profile: export\sPATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"`\n If you still have an issue, run the following command: brew\slink\s--force\slibpq\n Install Sui locally Use the following command to clone the Sui repo, change to the Sui folder after the clone completes, and then use cargo to install the sui-test-validator and sui binaries from your local drive. #\sClone\sthe\srepository\ngit\sclone\shttps://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git\n#\sMake\ssui\sthe\sworking\sdirectory\ncd\ssui\n#\sBuild\sSui\ncargo\sbuild\s--bin\ssui-test-validator\s--bin\ssui\n Install Sui from GitHub Use the following command to install Sui directly from the Sui GitHub repository: cargo\sinstall\s--locked\s--git\shttps://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git\s--branch\smain\ssui-test-validator\ssui\n Note that the command uses the main branch of the Sui repository. To use a different branch, change the value for the --branch switch. For example, to use the devnet branch, specify --branch\sdevnet. Start the local network To start the local network, run the following command from the sui root folder. RUST_LOG="consensus=off"\scargo\srun\s--bin\ssui-test-validator\n The command starts the sui-test-validator. The RUST_LOG=consensus=off turns off consensus for the local network. Important: Each time you start the sui-test-validator, the network starts as a new network with no previous data. The local network is not persistent. To customize your local Sui network, such as changing the port used, include additional parameters in the command to start sui-test-validator: OPTIONS:\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s--epoch-duration-ms\s<EPOCH_DURATION_MS>\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sThe\sduration\sfor\sepochs\s(defaults\sto\sone\sminute)\s[default:\s60000]\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s--faucet-port\s<FAUCET_PORT>\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sPort\sto\sstart\sthe\sSui\sfaucet\son\s[default:\s9123]\n\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s--fullnode-rpc-port\s<FULLNODE_RPC_PORT>\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sPort\sto\sstart\sthe\sFullnode\sRPC\sserver\son\s[default:\s9000]\n Use sui-validator-test\s--help to see these options in your console. Access your local Full node Use the following command to retrieve the total transaction count from your local network: curl\s--location\s--request\sPOST\s'http://127.0.0.1:9000'\s\\n--header\s'Content-Type:\sapplication/json'\s\\n--data-raw\s'{\n\s\s"jsonrpc":\s"2.0",\n\s\s"id":\s1,\n\s\s"method":\s"sui_getTotalTransactionBlocks",\n\s\s"params":\s[]\n}'\n If successful, the response resembles the following: {\n\s\s\s\s"jsonrpc":\s"2.0",\n\s\s\s\s"result":\s168,\n\s\s\s\s"id":\s1\n}\n Connect the Sui Client CLI to your local network You can use the Sui Client CLI with any Sui network. By default it connects to Sui Devnet. To connect to your local network, create a new environment alias named local that sets the RPC URL the client uses to your local network. sui\sclient\snew-env\s--alias\slocal\s--rpc\shttp://127.0.0.1:9000\n Next, use the following command to set the active environment to the new local environment you created. sui\sclient\sswitch\s--env\slocal\n The command returns: Active\senvironment\sswitched\sto\s[local] You can check the current active environment with the following command: sui\sclient\sactive-env\n The command returns: local Show the current active address The Sui Client CLI uses the active address for command if you don't specify one. Use the following command to show the active address on your local network. sui\sclient\sactive-address\n The command returns an address: 0xbc33e6e4818f9f2ef77d020b35c24be738213e64d9e58839ee7b4222029610de Use the active address to get test SUI to use on your local network. Use the sui\sclient\saddresses command to see all of the addresses on your local network. Note: The address returned when you run the command is unique and does not match the one used in this example. Use the local faucet Transactions on your local network require SUI coins to pay for gas fees just like other networks. To send coins to a Sui Wallet connected to your local network, see Set up a local Sui Wallet. You can use the address for the local Sui Wallet with the faucet.

Use the instructions appropriate for your operating system. After you install pnpm, use the following command to install the required dependencies in your workspace: pnpm\sinstall\n After the installation completes, run the following command to install Sui Wallet and Sui Explorer: pnpm\sturbo\sbuild\n If you encounter an error from turbo build, confirm that there is no package-lock.json. If the file exists, remove it and then run the command again. Set up Sui Explorer on your local network To connect the live Sui Explorer to your local network, open the URL:https://explorer.sui.io/?network=local. The live version of Sui Explorer may not include recent updates added to the main branch of the Sui repo. To use Sui Explorer that includes the most recent updates, install and run Sui Explorer from your local clone of the Sui repo. Run the following command from the sui root folder: Note: To run the command you have pnpm installed. See Install Sui Wallet and Sui Explorer locally for details. pnpm\sexplorer\sdev\n After the command completes, open your local Sui Explorer at the following URL: http://localhost:3000/. For more details about Sui Explorer, see the Explorer README. Set up a local Sui Wallet You can also use a local Sui Wallet to test with your local network. You can then see transactions executed from your local Sui Wallet on your local Sui Explorer. Note: To run the command you must have pnpm installed. See Install Sui Wallet and Sui Explorer locally for details. Before you start the Sui Wallet app, update its default environment to point to your local network. To do so, first make a copy of sui/apps/wallet/configs/environment/.env.defaults and rename it to .env in the same directory. In your .env file, edit the first line to read API_ENV=local and then save the file. Run the following command from the sui root folder to start Sui Wallet on your local network: pnpm\swallet\sstart\n Add local Sui Wallet to Chrome After you build your local version of Sui Wallet, you can add the extension to Chrome: Open a Chrome browser to chrome://extensions. Click the Developer mode toggle to enable, if it's not already on. Click the Load unpacked button and select your sui/apps/wallet/dist directory. Consult the Sui Wallet Readme for more information on working with a locally built wallet on Chrome. Generate example data Use the TypeScript SDK to add example data to your network. Note: To run the command you must complete the Pre-requisites\sfor\sBuilding\sApps\slocally section first. Run the following command from the sui root folder: pnpm\ssdk\stest:e2e\n For additional information about example data for testing, see https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/typescript#testing. Troubleshooting If you do not use Node.js 18, you might see the following message: Retrying\srequesting\sfrom\sfaucet:\sRetry\sfailed:\sfetch\sis\snot\sdefined To resolve this, switch or update to Node.js 18 and then try again. Test with the Sui TypeScript SDK The published version of the Sui TypeScript SDK might be an earlier version than the version of Sui you installed for your local network. To make sure you're using the latest version of the SDK, use the experimental-tagged version (for example, 0.0.0-experimental-20230317184920) in the Current Tags section of the Sui NPM registry.

Overview The Move language directory consists of four main parts: virtual machine (VM) — contains the bytecode format, a bytecode interpreter, and infrastructure for executing a block of transactions. This directory also contains the infrastructure to generate the genesis block. bytecode verifier — contains a static analysis tool for rejecting invalid Move bytecode. The virtual machine runs the bytecode verifier on any new Move code it encounters before executing it. The compiler runs the bytecode verifier on its output and surfaces the errors to the programmer. move-compiler — contains the Move source language compiler. standard library — contains the standard library transaction scripts. Exploring the Move language You can find many small Move examples in the tests directory. The easiest way to experiment with Move is to create a new test in this directory and run it with cargo\stest. Footer © 2023 GitHub, Inc.

In Sui, you write Smart Contracts with the Sui Move Programming language. This page links to key Move resources and compares the Move and Solidity programming languages. For a full description of the issues with traditional smart contract languages, see the Move Problem Statement. Sui Move First, note Move is based upon the well-supported Rust programming language. And Sui Move differs from core Move in subtle yet distinct ways. Here are resources to ramp up on Sui Move: Sui Move announcement Sui source code rustdoc output Sui Move by Example Move resources This section aggregates links to external resources on the Move programming language. See also our Smart Contracts with Move page and Move Programming with Objects tutorial series for key Move resources in this site. Move & Sui podcast on Zero Knowledge where programmable objects are described in detail. Original Move Book written by a member of the Sui team. Core Move documentation, including: Tutorial - A step-by-step guide through writing a Move module. Book - A summary with pages on various topics. Examples - A set of samples, such as for defining a coin and swapping it. Awesome Move - A summary of resources related to Move, from blockchains through code samples. Move vs. Solidity Currently, the main player on the blockchain languages scene is Solidity. As one of the first blockchain languages, Solidity was designed to implement basic programming language concepts using well known data types (e.g. byte array, string) and data structures (such as hashmaps) with the ability to build custom abstractions using a well-known base. However, as blockchain technology developed it became clear that the main purpose of blockchain languages is operating on digital assets, and the main quality of such languages is security and verifiability (which is an additional layer of security). Move was specifically designed to address both problems: representation of digital assets and safe operations over them. To provide additional protection, it has been co-developed along with the Move Prover verification tool. This allows Move developers to write formal specifications for the key correctness properties of their application, then use the prover to check that these properties will hold for all possible transactions and inputs. One fundamental difference between the EVM and Move is the data model for assets: EVM assets are encoded as entries in owner_address\s->\s<bytes\sencoding\sasset> hash maps. Asset updates and transfers work by updating entries in this map. There is no type or value representing an asset, and thus an asset cannot be passed as an argument, returned from a function, or be stored inside of another asset. Only unstructured bytes can be passed across contract boundaries, and thus each asset is forever trapped inside the contract that defines it. Move assets are arbitrary user-defined types. Assets can be passed as arguments, returned from functions, and stored inside other assets. In addition, assets can flow freely across contract boundaries without losing their integrity thanks to Move's built-in resource safety 1 2 protections. Sui heavily leverages the Move data model for performance. Sui's persistent state is a set of programmable Move objects that can be updated, created, and destroyed by transactions. Each object has ownership metadata that allows Sui validators to both execute and commit transactions using the object in parallel with causally unrelated transactions. Move's type system ensures the integrity of this ownership metadata across executions. The result is a system where developers write ordinary Move smart contracts, but validators leverage the data model to execute and commit transactions as efficiently as possible. This is simply not possible with the EVM data model. Because assets are stored in dynamically indexable maps, a validator would be unable to determine when transactions might touch the same asset. Sui's parallel execution and commitment scheme needs a language like Move with the vocabulary to describe structured assets that can flow freely across contracts. To be blunt: even if we preferred the EVM/Solidity to Move, we could not use them in Sui without sacrificing the performance breakthroughs that make Sui unique. One of the main advantages of Move is data composability. It is always possible to create a new struct (asset) Y that will hold initial asset X in it. Even more - with addition of generics, it is possible to define generic wrapper Z(T) that will be able to wrap any asset, providing additional properties to a wrapped asset or combining it with others. See how composability works in our Sandwich example.

Why We Created Sui Move The Sui Blog Sui Foundation Home About Contribute an Article Sui Move Why We Created Sui Move Sui Foundation Jul 15, 2022 11 min Sui is the first blockchain to improve on the original Diem design in how it integrates Move, and we share concrete examples of these improvements. Move was born in 2018 during the early days of the Libra project--two Mysten founders (Evan and myself) were also on the founding team of Libra. Before we made the decision to create a new language, the early Libra team intensely studied existing smart contract use cases and languages to understand what developers wanted to do and where existing languages were not delivering. The key problem we identified is that smart contracts are all about assets and access control, yet early smart contract languages lack type/value representations for both. The Move hypothesis is that if we provide first-class abstractions for these key concepts, we can significantly improve both the safety of smart contracts and the productivity of smart contract programmers—having the right vocabulary for the task at hand changes everything. Over the years, numerous folks contributed to the design and implementation of Move as the language evolved from a key idea into a platform-agnostic smart contract language with the bold goal of becoming the "JavaScript of web3".Today, we are excited to announce a milestone in our integration of Move into Sui: Sui Move is feature complete, supported by advanced tooling, and has extensive documentation and examples, including:A tutorial series on programming with Sui Move objectsA cookbook of Sui Move basics, design patterns, and samplesEnhanced VSCode plugin with support for code comprehension and error diagnostics built by the Mysten Move team!Integration of Move builds, tests, package management, documentation generation, and the Move Prover with the sui CLIA suite of examples including fungible tokens, NFT’s, DeFi, and games.When we started working on Sui in late 2021, we took a fresh look at Move and reflected both on which early design decisions have not aged well and on how Move could be improved to leverage Sui’s unique features. We have previously written about what’s new in Sui Move at the language level, but we haven’t gone into depth on the motivation for introducing these differences. The remainder of this post covers this inquiry in detail in an example-driven fashion.Wait, there are different Move’s?Move is a cross-platform, embedded language. The core language itself is very simple: it has generic concepts, such as structs, integers, and addresses, but it does not have blockchain-specific concepts like accounts, transactions, time, cryptography, etc. These features must be provided by the blockchain platform that integrates Move. Importantly, these blockchains do not need their own fork of Move—each platform uses the same Move VM, bytecode verifier, compiler, prover, package manager, and CLI, but adds blockchain-specific features via code that builds on top of these core components.Diem was the first blockchain to embed Move, and subsequent Move-based chains (including 0L, StarCoin, and Aptos) have largely used the Diem-style approach. Although Diem-style Move has some nice qualities, both the permissioned nature of Diem and certain implementation details of the Diem blockchain (particularly the storage model) make the implementation of some fundamental smart contract use cases difficult. In particular, the original designs of Move and Diem predated the popularity explosion of NFTs and have some quirks that make NFT-related use cases especially tricky to implement.In this post, we will walk through three such examples that showcase a problem with the original Diem-style Move embedding and depict how we have addressed this problem in Sui Move. We assume some basic understanding of Move, but hopefully, the key points will be understandable to anyone with a programming background.Frictionless mass asset creationThe ability to create and distribute assets in bulk is crucially important for both onboarding and engaging web3 users. Perhaps a Twitch streamer wants to distribute commemorative NFTs, a creator wants to send out tickets for a special event, or a game developer wants to airdrop new items to all of its players.Here is a (failed) attempt to write code for mass minting of an asset in Diem-style Move. This code takes a vector of recipient addresses as input, generates an asset for each one, and attempts to transfer the asset.struct\sCoolAsset\s{\sid:\sGUID,\screation_date:\su64\s}\shas\skey,\sstore\npublic\sentry\sfun\smass_mint(creator:\s&signer,\srecipients:\svector<address>)\s{\n\s\sassert!(signer::address_of(creator)\s==\sCREATOR,\sEAuthFail);\n\s\slet\si\s=\s0;\n\s\swhile\s(!vector::is_empty(recipients))\s{\n\s\s\s\slet\srecipient\s=\svector::pop_back(&mut\srecipients);\n\s\s\s\sassert!(exists<Account>(recipient),\sENoAccountAtAddress);\n\s\s\s\slet\sid\s=\sguid::create(creator);\n\s\s\s\slet\screation_date\s=\stimestamp::today();\n\s\s\s\s//\serror!\srecipient\smust\sbe\s`&signer`,\snot\s`address`\n\s\s\s\smove_to(recipient,\sCoolAsset\s{\sid,\screation_date\s})\n}In Diem-style Move, the global storage is keyed by (address, type name) pairs—that is, every address can store at most one asset of a given type. Thus, the line move_to(recipient,\sCoolAsset\s{\s...\s} is attempting to transfer the CoolAsset by storing it under the recipient address.However, this code will fail to compile at the line move_to(recipient,\s…). The key problem is that in Diem-style Move, you cannot send a value of type CoolAsset to an address A unless:A non-A address sends a transaction to create an account at AThe owner of A sends a transaction to explicitly opt-in to receiving objects of type CoolAssetThat’s two transactions just to receive an asset! The decision to do things this way made sense for Diem, which was a permissioned system that needed to carefully restrict account creation and prevent accounts from holding too many assets due to limitations in the storage system. But this is extremely restrictive for an open system that wants to use asset distribution as onboarding mechanism, or just generally allow assets to flow freely between users as they do on Ethereum and similar blockchains [1].Now, let’s look at the same code in Sui Move:struct\sCoolAsset\s{\sid:\sVersionedID,\screation_date:\su64\s}\shas\skey\npublic\sentry\sfun\smass_mint(recipients:\svector<address>,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext)\s{\n\s\sassert!(tx_context::sender(ctx)\s==\sCREATOR,\sEAuthFail);\n\s\slet\si\s=\s0;\n\s\swhile\s(!vector::is_empty(recipients))\s{\n\s\s\s\slet\srecipient\s=\svector::pop_back(&mut\srecipients);\n\s\s\s\slet\sid\s=\stx_context::new_id(ctx);\n\s\s\s\slet\screation_date\s=\stx_context::epoch();\s//\sSui\sepochs\sare\s24\shours\n\s\s\s\stransfer(CoolAsset\s{\sid,\screation_date\s},\srecipient)\n\s\s}\n}Sui Move’s global storage keyed by object ID’s. Every struct with the key ability is a “Sui object” that must have a globally unique id field. Instead of using the restricted move_to construct, Sui Move introduces a transfer primitive that can be used on any Sui object. Under the hood, this primitive maps id to CoolAsset in the global storage and adds metadata to indicate the value is owned by recipient.An interesting property of the Sui version of mass_mint is that it commutes with all other transactions (including others that call mass_mint!). The Sui runtime will notice this and send transactions that call this function through the Byzantine consistent broadcast “fast path” that doesn’t need consensus. Such transactions can be both committed and executed in parallel! This requires no effort from the programmer—they just write the code above and the runtime takes care of the rest.Perhaps subtly, this is not true of the Diem variant of this code—even if the code above worked, both the exists<Account> and guid::create calls would create points of contention with other transactions generating GUIDs or touching the Account resource. In some cases, it’s possible to rewrite Diem-style Move code to avoid points of contention, but many of the idiomatic ways of writing Diem-style Move introduce subtle bottlenecks that frustrate parallel execution.Native asset ownership and transfersLet’s extend the Diem-style Move code with a workaround that will actually compile and run. The idiomatic way to do this is the “wrapper pattern”: because Bob can’t directly move_to a CoolAsset to Alice’s address, we ask Alice to “opt in” to receiving CoolAsset's by first publishing a wrapper type CoolAssetStore with a collection type (Table) inside. Alice can do this by calling the opt_in function. We then add code that allows Bob to move a CoolAsset from his CoolAssetStore into Alice’s CoolAssetStore.In this code, let’s add one other wrinkle: we will only allow CoolAsset's to be transferred if it has been at least 30 days since they were created. This sort of policy is important for creators that (e.g.) want to discourage speculators from purchasing/flipping event tickets so it is easier for true fans to get them at a reasonable price.struct\sCoolAssetStore\shas\skey\s{\n\s\sassets:\sTable<TokenId,\sCoolAsset>\n}\npublic\sfun\sopt_in(addr:\s&signer)\s{\n\s\smove_to(addr,\sCoolAssetHolder\s{\sassets:\stable::new()\s}\n}\npublic\sentry\sfun\scool_transfer(\n\s\saddr:\s&signer,\srecipient:\saddress,\sid:\sTokenId\n)\sacquires\sCoolAssetStore\s{\n\s\s//\swithdraw\n\s\slet\ssender\s=\ssigner::address_of(addr);\n\s\sassert!(exists<CoolAssetStore>(sender),\sETokenStoreNotPublished);\n\s\slet\ssender_assets\s=\s&mut\sborrow_global_mut<CoolAssetStore>(sender).assets;\s\n\s\sassert!(table::contains(sender_assets,\sid),\sETokenNotFound);\n let\sasset\s=\stable::remove(&sender_assets,\sid);\n\s\s//\scheck\sthat\s30\sdays\shave\selapsed\n\s\sassert!(time::today()\s>\sasset.creation_date\s+\s30,\sECantTransferYet)\n //\sdeposit\n assert!(exists<CoolAssetStore>(recipient),\sETokenStoreNotPublished);\n\s\slet\srecipient_assets\s=\s&mut\sborrow_global_mut<CoolAssetStore>(recipient).assets;\s\n\s\sassert!(table::contains(recipient_assets,\sid),\sETokenIdAlreadyUsed);\n\s\stable::add(recipient_assets,\sasset)\n}This code works. But it’s a pretty complex way to accomplish the simple goal of transferring an asset from Alice to Bob! Again, let’s look at the Sui Move variant:public\sentry\sfun\scool_transfer(\n\s\sasset:\sCoolAsset,\srecipient:\saddress,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext\n)\s{\n\s\sassert!(tx_context::epoch(ctx)\s>\sasset.creation_date\s+\s30,\sECantTransferYet);\n\s\stransfer(asset,\srecipient)\n}This code is much shorter. The key thing to notice here is that cool_transfer is an entry function (meaning it can be called directly by the Sui runtime via a transaction), yet it has a parameter of type CoolAsset as an input. This is Sui runtime magic at work again! A transaction includes the set of object ID’s it wants to operate on, and the Sui runtime:Resolves the ID’s to object values (removing the need for the borrow_global_mut and table_remove parts in the Diem-style code above)Checks that the object is owned by the sender of the transaction (removing the need for the signer::address_of part + associated code above). This part is especially interesting, as we will explain shortly: in Sui, safe object ownership ownership checks are part of the runtime!Checks the types of the object values against the parameter types of the invoked function cool_transferBinds the object values and other arguments to the parameters of cool_transfer and invokes the functionThis allows the Sui Move programmer to skip the boilerplate of the “withdraw” part of the logic and jump straight to the interesting part: checking the 30-day expiration policy. Similarly, the “deposit” part is vastly simplified via the Sui Move transfer construct explained above. And finally, there’s no need to introduce a wrapper type like CoolAssetStore with an internal collection—the id-indexed Sui global storage allows an address to store an arbitrary number of values with a given type.One other difference to point out is that there are 5 ways the Diem-style cool_transfer can abort (i.e., fail and charge the user for gas without completing the transfer), whereas the Sui Move cool_transfer can only abort in 1 way: when the 30-day policy is violated.Offloading object ownership checks to the runtime is a big win not only in terms of ergonomics, but also in terms of safety. Safe implementations of this at the runtime level prevents the mistakes of implementing these checks (or forgetting them entirely!) by construction.Finally, notice how the Sui Move entry point function signature cool_transfer(\sasset:\sCoolAsset,\s...) gives us a lot of information about what the function is going to do (in contrast to the Diem-style function signature, which is more opaque). We can think of this function as asking permission to transfer CoolAsset, whereas a different function f(asset:\s&mut\sCoolAsset,\s...) is asking for permission to write (but not transfer) CoolAsset, and g(asset:\s&CoolAsset,\s...) is only asking for read permissions.Because this information is available directly in the function signature (no execution or static analysis required!), it can be used directly by the wallet and other client tooling. In the Sui wallet, we are working on human-readable signing requests that leverage these structured function signatures to provide an iOS/Android-style permissions prompt to the user. The wallet can say something like “This transaction is asking for permission read your CoolAsset, write your AssetCollection, and transfer your ConcertTicket. Proceed?”.Human-readable signing requests address a massive attack vector present on many existing platforms (including ones using Diem-style Move!), where wallet users must blindly sign transactions without understanding what their effects might be. We think making the wallet experience less dangerous is a key step for promoting mainstream adoption of crypto wallets, and have designed Sui Move to support this goal by enabling features like human-readable signing requests.Bundling heterogenous assetsFinally, let’s consider an example concerning bundling assets of different types. This is a fairly common use-case: a programmer might might want to package NFT’s of different types in a collection, bundle items to be sold together in a marketplace, or add accessories to an existing item. Concretely, let’s say we have to following scenario:Alice has defined a Character object to be used in a gameAlice wants to support accessorizing her character with third-party accessories of different types created laterAnyone should be able to create an accessory, but the owner of a Character should decide whether to add an accessory or not.Transferring a Character should automatically transfer all of its accessories.This time, let’s start with the Sui Move code. We will take advantage of another facet of the Sui runtime’s built-in object ownership feature: an object can be owned by another object. Every object has a unique owner, but a parent object can have an arbitrary number of child objects. Parent/child object relationships are created by using the transfer_to_object function, a sibling of the transfer function introduced above.//\sin\sthe\sCharacter\smodule,\screated\sby\sAlice\nstruct\sCharacter\shas\skey\s{\n\s\sid:\sVersionedID,\n\s\sfavorite_color:\su8,\n\s\sstrength:\su64,\n\s\s...\n}\n///\sThe\sowner\sof\s`c`\scan\schoose\sto\sadd\s`accessory`\npublic\sentry\sfun\saccessorize<T:\skey>(c:\s&mut\sCharacter,\saccessory:\sT)\s{\n\s\stransfer_to_object(c,\saccessory)\n}\n//\s...\sin\sa\smodule\sadded\slater\sby\sBob\nstruct\sSpecialShirt\shas\skey\s{\n\s\sid:\sVersionedID,\n\s\scolor:\su8\n}\npublic\sentry\sfun\sdress(c:\s&mut\sCharacter,\ss:\sShirt)\s{\n\s\s//\sa\sspecial\sshirt\shas\sto\sbe\sthe\scharacter's\sfavorite\scolor\n\s\sassert!(character::favorite_color(c)\s==\ss.color,\sEBadColor);\n\s\scharacter::accessorize(c,\sshirt)\n}\n//\s...\sin\sa\s\smodule\sadded\slater\sby\sClarissa\nstruct\sSword\shas\skey\s{\n\s\sid:\sVersionedID,\n\s\spower:\su64\n}\npublic\sentry\sfun\sequip(c:\s&mut\sCharacter,\ss:\sSword)\s{\n\s\s//\sa\scharacter\smust\sbe\svery\sstrong\sto\suse\sa\spowerful\ssword\n\s\sassert!(character::strength(c)\s>\ssword.power\s*\s2,\sENotStrongEnough);\n\s\scharacter::accessorize(c,\ss)\n}In this code, the Character module includes an accessorize function that lets the owner of a character add an accessory object with an arbitrary type as a child object. This allows Bob and Clarissa to create their own accessory types with different attributes and functionality that were not anticipated by Alice, yet build on what Alice has already done. For example, Bob’s shirt can only be equipped if it is the character’s favorite color, and Clarissa’s sword can only be used if the character is strong enough to wield it.In Diem-style Move, it is not possible to implement this sort of scenario. Here are a few attempts at implementation strategies that fall short://\sattempt\s1\nstruct\sCharacter\s{\n\s\s//\swon't\swork\sbecause\severy\sAccessory\swould\sneed\sto\sbe\sthe\ssame\stype\s+\shave\n\s\s//\sthe\ssame\sfields.\sThere\sis\sno\ssubtyping\sin\sMove.\n\s\s//\sBob's\sshirt\sneeds\sa\scolor,\sand\sClarissa's\ssword\sneeds\spower--no\sstandard\n\s\s//\srepresentation\sof\sAccessory\scan\santicipate\severything\sdevs\swill\swant\sto\n\s\s//\screate\n\s\saccessories:\svector<Accessory>\n}\n//\sattempt\s2\nstruct\sCharacter\s{\n\s\s//\sperhaps\sAlice\santicipates\sthe\sneed\sfor\sa\sSword\sand\sa\sShirt\sup\sfront...\n\s\ssword:\sOption<Sword>,\n\s\sshirt:\sOption<Shirt>\n\s\s//\s...but\swhat\shappens\swhen\sDaniel\scomes\salong\slater\sand\swants\sto\sadd\sPants?\n}\n//\sattempt\s3\n//\sDoes\snot\ssupport\saccessory\scompositions.\sFor\sexample:\show\sdo\swe\srepresent\sa\s\n//\sCharacter\swith\sPants\sand\sa\sShirt,\sbut\sno\sSword?\nstruct\sShirt\s{\sc:\sCharacter\s}\nstruct\sSword\s{\ss:\sShirt\s}\nstruct\sPants\s{\ss:\sSword\s}The key problems are that in Diem-style Move:Only homogenous collections are supported (as the first attempt demonstrates), but accessories are fundamentally heterogenousAssociations between objects can be created only via “wrapping” (i.e., storing an object inside another object); but the set of objects that can be wrapped must be defined up-front (as in the second attempt) or added in an ad-hoc fashion that does not support accessory composition (as in the third attempt)ConclusionSui is the first platform to diverge substantially from the original Diem design in how it uses Move. Designing embeddings that fully leverage Move and the unique features of the platform is both an art and a science that requires a deep understanding of both the Move language and the underlying blockchain’s capabilities. We’re really excited about the advances Sui Move has made and the new use cases it will enable![1] Another argument made in favor of the Diem-style Move policy of “must opt-in to receive an asset of a given type” is that it is a good mechanism for spam prevention. However, we think spam prevention belongs to the application layer. Rather than asking users to send transactions that cost real money to opt in to receiving an asset, spam is easily addressed at (e.g.) the wallet level with rich user-defined policies and the aid of automated spam filters.

One SUI Coin Will Soon Equal a Billion MIST The Sui Blog Sui Foundation Home About Contribute an Article Tokenomics One SUI Coin Will Soon Equal a Billion MIST Sui Foundation Oct 19, 2022 2 min MIST is the smallest unit of SUI, equal 10^-9 of a SUI. One billion MIST equals one SUI. Today we're excited to introduce MIST, the smallest unit of a SUI Coin. This new SUI division allows greater flexibility for SUI transactions. This introduction means that a Coin<SUI> with value of 1 equals 1 MIST, and 1 MIST equals 10^-9 of a SUI. In other words, 1 SUI equals 1 billion MIST. A fun fact is that flip(10\smist) = mist 10 ~= Mysten!Blockchain coins commonly offer different denominations, such as Ethereum’s WEI and Solana’s lamport. The introduction of MIST will offer better support for micropayments, including very low gas fees. Further, utilizing MIST will mitigate the insufficient gas problems caused by coin dusts (meaning coins with very low balance like 10^-8 SUI).The SUI coin balance in Move or Sui protocol used to be interpreted as SUI directly. For example, a SUI coin with a balance of 100 used to be interpreted as 100 SUI. With the MIST update, the value will be interpreted as 100 MIST or 10^-7 SUI.You will see the new SUI and MIST value display logic in Sui Wallet and Sui Explorer very soon.Key ChangesOur team worked on several areas to implement this change:On SDKs, we added functions to convert coin values between SUI and MISTOn Sui Wallet and Sui Explorer, we will soon update displayed values to illustrate that they are divided by 10^9 and in the format of decimal numbers instead of big integers. The wallet transfer flow will change accordingly.On faucet, the allocated gas number will increase to 50,000,000, or 0.05 SUI.There will be no change on Move or Sui protocol.An example of SUI displayed with decimals in Sui WalletWe also recommend that dApp developers adapt the new value rendering, as we will do in Sui Wallet and Explorer. To be more specific:When rendering SUI coin balance, update the unit to MIST; Or divide the value by 10*9 and render SUI in a decimal number format.For actions around SUI coin, users will be able to input decimal numbers. Sui will translate that value to MISTs before using the value to communicate with Sui protocol like RPC and Move functions.This will show as .2 SUI when the new display logic landsIn addition to adding support for denominations of SUI token, the team is also working to support denominations of other custom fungible tokens in a scalable way – stay tuned!

Before you install Sui, you need to install some prerequisite tools and configure your development environment. The steps to install Sui include: Install prerequisites for your operating system. Install Sui binaries. Configure an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Request SUI test tokens to use on a Sui network. You can also download the source code to have local access to files. Sui repository The Sui repository includes two primary branches, devnet and main. The devnet branch includes the latest stable build of Sui. Choose the devnet branch if you want to build or test on Sui. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the main branch. To submit a pull request (PR), you should push commits to your fork of the main branch. The main branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the main branch if you want to contribute to the Sui project. The main branch may include unreleased changes, or introduce changes that cause issues in apps created using an earlier version. Documentation in the Sui repository The source for the documentation published on this site also resides in the Sui repository. The content differs between the branches of the repository just like the Sui source code. Use the version of the documentation that corresponds to the Sui network you plan to use. For example, to use the Sui Devnet network, use the Devnet version of the documentation. To use the Sui Testnet network, use the Testnet version of the documentation. Supported operating systems Sui supports the following operating systems: Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver) macOS - macOS Monterey Microsoft Windows - Windows 11 Prerequisites Install the following prerequisites and tools you need to work with Sui. PrerequisiteLinuxmacOSWindows 11cURLXXXRust and CargoXXXGit CLIXXXCMakeXXXGCCXlibssl-devXlibclang-devXlibpq-devXbuild-essentialXBrewXC++ build toolsXLLVM CompilerX Rust and Cargo Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with rustup using cURL. Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system before you install Rust. Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux: curl\s--proto\s'=https'\s--tlsv1.2\s-sSf\shttps://sh.rustup.rs\s|\ssh\n If you use Windows 11, see information about using the Rust installer on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard. For additional installation options, see Install Rust. Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the Cargo installation page on the Rust website for more information. Use the following command to update Rust with rustup: rustup\supdate\sstable\n After you install Rust, proceed to the prerequisites for your operating system. Linux prerequisites macOS prerequisites Windows prerequisites Linux prerequisites Note: The Linux instructions assume a distribution that uses the APT package manager. You might need to adjust the instructions to use other package managers. Install the prerequisites listed in this section. Use the following command to update apt-get: sudo\sapt-get\supdate\n cURL Install cURL with the following command: sudo\sapt\sinstall\scurl\n Verify that cURL installed correctly with the following command: curl\s--version\n Git CLI Run the following command to install Git, including the Git CLI: sudo\sapt-get\sinstall\sgit-all\n For more information, see Install Git on Linux on the GitHub website.

Some key problems we see with today’s solutions are: Smart contract languages aren’t cross-platform. Languages overfit to implementation details of the blockchain they are designed for such as transaction and account structure, signing/hashing algorithms, and consensus algorithm. This frustrates interoperability, prevents smart contract reuse, and discourages communities from forming across platforms. A designer of a new platform is faced with a tough choice: either bootstrap an entirely new language and ecosystem, or use an existing language (e.g., Solidity/the EVM) that forces your new platform to inherit many limitations from the old one. The decentralized web needs a lingua franca that will allow platform creators to experiment with vastly different architectures without needing to create a new language for each one. Smart contract languages aren't safe enough. Multimillion dollar exploits are a regular occurrence. Effective smart contract developers must be experts in both security and their product. Language design mistakes (e.g., re-entrancy, insufficient access control features, silent integer overflow) increase the attack surface for contracts, make audits expensive and slow, and frustrate the adoption of formal verification. We believe that insufficient language safety is a serious barrier to both mainstream adoption of digital assets and accessible smart contract development. Smart contract execution layers aren't fast. In most platforms, transaction execution is sequential and low-throughput. Improving on this is challenging because existing languages are not designed with amenability to parallel execution in mind. In addition, most languages have unconventional features (e.g., large default integers that don't fit in a register, collections based on collision-resistant hashing with no data locality) that prevent improvements such as effective ahead-of-time or JIT compilation to native code. Insufficient throughput pushes gas prices to absurd levels and locks out users/use-cases that can’t afford them. Immature language ecosystems. Languages do not provide features for contract composition, leading to massive code duplication and wasting expensive on-chain storage. Conventional languages align on dedicated package managers (e.g., crates.io for Rust, npm for JavaScript, pip for Python) for sharing/building code, releases, bug fixes, vulnerability disclosure, etc., but no such package manager exists for smart contract languages. Instead, developers manually copy/paste and tweak popular templates. This immaturity makes it difficult to build (and perhaps even more importantly) maintain large applications. Bad end-user experience. End-users are directly exposed to design mistakes in today’s execution layers. A basic operation like "view all the assets my account owns" requires scanning the entire blockchain or relying on third-party infrastructure that does so. Wallets ask users to sign opaque transactions whose contents (or effects) cannot easily be understood. This opens the door to theft attempts like poison tokens or spoofing token approvals.

transactions are called Programmable Transaction Blocks. Get Started To get started using Programmable Transaction Blocks, make sure that you have the latest TypeScript SDK installed. This example starts by constructing a transaction block to send Sui. If you are familiar with the legacy Sui transaction types, this is similar to a paySui transaction. To construct transactions, import the TransactionBlock class, and construct it: import\s{\sTransactionBlock\s}\sfrom\s"@mysten/sui.js";\nconst\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n Using this, you can then add transactions to this transaction block. //\sCreate\sa\snew\scoin\swith\sbalance\s100,\sbased\son\sthe\scoins\sused\sas\sgas\spayment.\n//\sYou\scan\sdefine\sany\sbalance\shere.\nconst\s[coin]\s=\stxb.splitCoins(txb.gas,\s[txb.pure(100)]);\n\n//\sTransfer\sthe\ssplit\scoin\sto\sa\sspecific\saddress.\ntxb.transferObjects([coin],\stxb.pure("0xSomeSuiAddress"));\n Note that you can attach multiple transactions of the same type to a transaction block as well. For example, to get a list of transfers, and iterate over them to transfer coins to each of them: interface\sTransfer\s{\n\s\sto:\sstring;\n\s\samount:\snumber;\n}\n\n//\sProcure\sa\slist\sof\ssome\sSui\stransfers\sto\smake:\nconst\stransfers:\sTransfer[]\s=\sgetTransfers();\n\nconst\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n\n//\sFirst,\ssplit\sthe\sgas\scoin\sinto\smultiple\scoins:\nconst\scoins\s=\stxb.splitCoins(\n\s\stxb.gas,\n\s\stransfers.map((transfer)\s=>\stxb.pure(transfer.amount))\n);\n\n//\sNext,\screate\sa\stransfer\stransaction\sfor\seach\scoin:\ntransfers.forEach((transfer,\sindex)\s=>\s{\n\s\stxb.transferObjects([coins[index]],\stxb.pure(transfer.to));\n});\n After you have the transaction block defined, you can directly execute it with a signer using signAndExecuteTransactionBlock. signer.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({\stransactionBlock:\stxb\s});\n Inputs and transactions Programmable Transaction Blocks have two key concepts: inputs and transactions. Inputs are values that are used as arguments to the transactions in the transaction block. Inputs can either be an object reference (either to an owned object, an immutable object, or a shared object), or a pure BCS value (for example, an encoded string used as an argument to a move call). Transactions are steps of execution in the transaction block. You can also use the result of previous transaction as an argument to future transactions. By combining multiple transactions together, Programmable Transaction Blocks provide a flexible way to create complex transactions. Constructing inputs Inputs are how you provide external values to transaction blocks. For example, defining an amount of Sui to transfer, or which object to pass into a Move call, or a shared object. There are currently two ways to define inputs: For objects: the txb.object(objectId) function is used to construct an input that contains an object reference. For pure values: the txb.pure(rawValue) function is used, and returns an input reference that you use in transactions. Available transactions Sui supports following transactions: txb.splitCoins(coin,\samounts) - Creates new coins with the defined amounts, split from the provided coin. Returns the coins so that it can be used in subsequent transactions. Example: txb.splitCoins(txb.gas,\s[txb.pure(100),\stxb.pure(200)]) txb.mergeCoins(destinationCoin,\ssourceCoins) - Merges the sourceCoins into the destinationCoin. Example: txb.mergeCoins(txb.object(coin1),\s[txb.object(coin2),\stxb.object(coin3)]) txb.transferObjects(objects,\saddress) - Transfers a list of objects to the specified address. Example: txb.transferObjects([txb.object(thing1),\stxb.object(thing2)],\stxb.pure(myAddress)) txb.moveCall({\starget,\sarguments,\stypeArguments\s\s}) - Executes a Move call. Returns whatever the Sui Move call returns. Example: txb.moveCall({\starget:\s'0x2::devnet_nft::mint',\sarguments:\s[txb.pure(name),\stxb.pure(description),\stxb.pure(image)]\s}) txb.makeMoveVec({\stype,\sobjects\s}) - Constructs a vector of objects that can be passed into a moveCall. This is required as there’s no way to define a vector as an input. Example: txb.makeMoveVec({\sobjects:\s[txb.object(id1),\stxb.object(id2)]\s}) txb.publish(modules,\sdependencies) - Publishes a Move package. Returns the upgrade capability object. Passing transaction results as arguments You can use the result of a transaction as an argument in a subsequent transactions. Each transaction method on the transaction builder returns a reference to the transaction result. //\sSplit\sa\scoin\sobject\soff\sof\sthe\sgas\sobject:\nconst\s[coin]\s=\stxb.splitCoins(txb.gas,\s[txb.pure(100)]);\n//\sTransfer\sthe\sresulting\scoin\sobject:\ntxb.transferObjects([coin],\stxb.pure(address));\n When a transaction returns multiple results, you can access the result at a specific index either using destructuring, or array indexes. //\sDestructuring\s(preferred,\sas\sit\sgives\syou\slogical\slocal\snames):\nconst\s[nft1,\snft2]\s=\stxb.moveCall({\starget:\s"0x2::nft::mint_many"\s});\ntxb.transferObjects([nft1,\snft2],\stxb.pure(address));\n\n//\sArray\sindexes:\nconst\smintMany\s=\stxb.moveCall({\starget:\s"0x2::nft::mint_many"\s});\ntxb.transferObjects([mintMany[0],\smintMany[1]],\stxb.pure(address));\n Use the gas coin With Programmable Transaction blocks, you can use the gas payment coin to construct coins with a set balance using splitCoin. This is useful for Sui payments, and avoids the need for up-front coin selection. You can use txb.gas to access the gas coin in a transaction block, and it is valid as input for any arguments, as long as it is used by-reference. Practically speaking, this means you can also add to the gas coin with mergeCoins and borrow it for Move functions with moveCall. You can also transfer the gas coin using transferObjects, in the event that you want to transfer all of your coin balance to another address. Get transaction block bytes If you need the transaction block bytes, instead of signing or executing the transaction block, you can use the build method on the transaction builder itself. Important: You might need to explicitly call setSender() on the transaction block to ensure that the sender field is populated. This is normally done by the signer before signing the transaction, but will not be done automatically if you’re building the transaction block bytes yourself. const\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n\n//\s...\sadd\ssome\stransactions...\n\nawait\stxb.build({\sprovider\s});\n In most cases, building requires your JSON RPC Provider to fully resolve input values. If you have transaction block bytes, you can also convert them back into a TransactionBlock class: const\sbytes\s=\sgetTransactionBlockBytesFromSomewhere();\nconst\stxb\s=\sTransactionBlock.from(bytes);\n Building Offline In the event that you want to build a transaction block offline (i.e. with no provider required), you need to fully define all of your input values, and gas configuration (see the following example). For pure values, you can provide a Uint8Array which will be used directly in the transaction. For objects, you can use the Inputs helper to construct an object reference. import\s{\sInputs\s}\sfrom\s"@mysten/sui.js";\n\n//\sFor\spure\svalues:\ntxb.pure(pureValueAsBytes);\n\n//\sFor\sowned\sor\simmutable\sobjects:\ntxb.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({\sdigest,\sobjectId,\sversion\s}));\n\n//\sFor\sshared\sobjects:\ntxb.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({\sobjectId,\sinitialSharedVersion,\smutable\s}));\n You can then omit the provider object when calling build on the transaction. If there is any required data that is missing, this will throw an error. Gas Configuration The new transaction builder comes with default behavior for all gas logic, including automatically setting the gas price, budget, and selecting coins to be used as gas. This behavior can be customized. Gas Price By default, the gas price is set to the reference gas price of the network. You can also explicitly set the gas price of the transaction block by calling setGasPrice on the transaction builder. txb.setGasPrice(gasPrice);\n Budget By default, the gas budget is automatically derived by executing a dry-run of the transaction block beforehand. The dry run gas consumption is then used to determine a balance for the transaction. You can override this behavior by explicitly setting a gas budget for the transaction, by calling setGasBudget on the transaction builder. Note: The gas budget is represented in Sui, and should take the gas price of the transaction block into account. txb.setGasBudget(gasBudgetAmount);\n Gas Payment By default, the gas payment is automatically determined by the SDK. The SDK selects all of the users coins that are not used as inputs in the transaction block. The list of coins used as gas payment will be merged down into a single gas coin before executing the transaction block, and all but one of the gas objects will be deleted. The gas coin at the 0-index will be the coin that all others are merged into. //\sNOTE:\sYou\sneed\sto\sensure\sthat\sthe\scoins\sdo\snot\soverlap\swith\sany\n//\sof\sthe\sinput\sobjects\sfor\sthe\stransaction\sblock.\ntxb.setGasPayment([coin1,\scoin2]);\n Dapp / Wallet Integration The Wallet Standard interface has been updated to support the TransactionBlock kind directly. All signTransaction and signAndExecuteTransaction calls from dapps into wallets will be expected to provide a TransactionBlock class. This transaction block class can then be serialized and sent to your wallet for execution. To serialize a transaction block for sending to a wallet, Sui recommends using the txb.serialize() function, which returns an opaque string representation of the transaction block that can be passed from the wallet standard dapp context to your wallet. This can then be converted back into a TransactionBlock using TransactionBlock.from(). Important: You should not build the transaction block from bytes in the dApp code. Using serialize instead of build allows you to build the transaction block bytes within the wallet itself. This allows the wallet to perform gas logic and coin selection as needed. //\sWithin\sa\sdApp\nconst\stx\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\nwallet.signTransactionBlock({\stransactionBlock:\stx\s});\n\n//\sYour\swallet\sstandard\scode:\nfunction\shandleSignTransactionBlock(input)\s{\n\s\ssendToWalletContext({\stransactionBlock:\sinput.transactionBlock.serialize()\s});\n}\n\n//\sWithin\syour\swallet\scontext:\nfunction\shandleSignRequest(input)\s{\n\s\sconst\suserTx\s=\sTransactionBlock.from(input.transaction);\n}\n Sponsored Transaction Blocks The transaction block builder can support sponsored transaction blocks by using the onlyTransactionKind flag when building the transaction block. const\stxb\s=\snew\sTransactionBlock();\n\n//\s...\sadd\ssome\stransactions...\n\nconst\skindBytes\s=\sawait\stxb.build({\sprovider,\sonlyTransactionKind:\strue\s});\n\n//\sConstruct\sa\ssponsored\stransaction\sfrom\sthe\skind\sbytes:\nconst\ssponsoredTxb\s=\sTransactionBlock.fromKind(kindBytes);\n\n//\sYou\scan\snow\sset\sthe\ssponsored\stransaction\sdata\sthat\sis\srequired:\nsponsoredTxb.setSender(sender);\nsponsoredTxb.setGasOwner(sponsor);\nsponsoredTxb.setGasPayment(sponsorCoins);\n Connect to Sui JSON-RPC API Last update 3/28/2023, 5:08:20 PM Contributor(s) Randall-MystenChris LiJordan Gensler Source Code Community Discord Twitter Medium GitHub Ecosystem Sui.io Sui Resources Sui Developer Forums Send Feedback Contact us (Email) Create an Issue (GitHub) Chat about Docs (Discord) Privacy Policy Terms of Service ©2023 Copyright Sui Foundation.

Additional Resources Light (default) Rust Coal Navy Ayu Sui Move by Example Publisher Publisher Object serves as a way to represent the publisher authority. The object itself does not imply any specific use case and has only two main functions: package::from_module<T> and package::from_package<T> which allow checking whether a type T belongs to a module or a package for which the Publisher object was created. We strongly advise to issue the Publisher object for most of the packages that define new Objects - it is required to set the "Display" as well as to allow the type to be traded in the "Kiosk" ecosystem. Although Publisher itself is a utility, it enables the "proof of ownership" functionality, for example, it is crucial for the Object Display. To set up a Publisher, a One-Time-Witness (OTW) is required - this way we ensure the Publisher object is initialized only once for a specific module (but can be multiple for a package) as well as that the creation function is called in the publish transaction. ///\sA\ssimple\spackage\sthat\sdefines\san\sOTW\sand\sclaims\sa\s`Publisher`\n///\sobject\sfor\sthe\ssender.\nmodule\sexamples::owner\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::tx_context::TxContext;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::package;\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sOTW\sis\sa\sstruct\swith\sonly\s`drop`\sand\sis\snamed\n\s\s\s\s///\safter\sthe\smodule\s-\sbut\suppercased.\sSee\s"One\sTime\n\s\s\s\s///\sWitness"\spage\sfor\smore\sdetails.\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sOWNER\shas\sdrop\s{}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sSome\sother\stype\sto\suse\sin\sa\sdummy\scheck\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sThisType\s{}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sAfter\sthe\smodule\sis\spublished,\sthe\ssender\swill\sreceive\n\s\s\s\s///\sa\s`Publisher`\sobject.\sWhich\scan\sbe\sused\sto\sset\sDisplay\n\s\s\s\s///\sor\smanage\sthe\stransfer\spolicies\sin\sthe\s`Kiosk`\ssystem.\n\s\s\s\sfun\sinit(otw:\sOWNER,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext)\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\spackage::claim_and_keep(otw,\sctx)\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n\n///\sA\smodule\sthat\sutilizes\sthe\s`Publisher`\sobject\sto\sgive\sa\stoken\n///\sof\sappreciation\sand\sa\s`TypeOwnerCap`\sfor\sthe\sowned\stype.\nmodule\sexamples::type_owner\s{\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::object::{Self,\sUID};\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::tx_context::TxContext;\n\s\s\s\suse\ssui::package::{Self,\sPublisher};\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sTrying\sto\sclaim\sownership\sof\sa\stype\swith\sa\swrong\s`Publisher`.\n\s\s\s\sconst\sENotOwner:\su64\s=\s0;\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sA\scapability\sgranted\sto\sthose\swho\swant\san\s"objective"\n\s\s\s\s///\sconfirmation\sof\stheir\sownership\s:)\n\s\s\s\sstruct\sTypeOwnerCap<phantom\sT>\shas\skey,\sstore\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sid:\sUID\n\s\s\s\s}\n\n\s\s\s\s///\sUses\sthe\s`Publisher`\sobject\sto\scheck\sif\sthe\scaller\sowns\sthe\stype\s`T`.\n\s\s\s\spublic\sfun\sprove_ownership<T>(\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\spublisher:\s&Publisher,\sctx:\s&mut\sTxContext\n\s\s\s\s):\sTypeOwnerCap<T>\s{\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sassert!(package::from_package<T>(publisher),\sENotOwner);\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sTypeOwnerCap<T>\s{\sid:\sobject::new(ctx)\s}\n\s\s\s\s}\n}\n

The system has 3 main audiences: Creators: for a type to be tradable in the Kiosk ecosystem, creator (publisher) of the type needs to issue a TransferPolicyCap which gives them a power to enforce any constraint on trades by either using one of the pre-built primitives (see sui::royalty) or by implementing a custom policy. The latter requires additional support for discoverability in the ecosystem and should be performed within the scope of an Application or some platform. A type can not be traded in the Kiosk unless there's a policy for it. 0-royalty policy is just as easy as "freezing" the AllowTransferCap making it available for everyone to authorize deals "for free" Traders: anyone can create a Kiosk and depending on whether it's a shared object or some shared-wrapper the owner can trade any type that has issued TransferPolicyCap in a Kiosk. To do so, they need to make an offer, and any party can purchase the item for the amount of SUI set in the offer. The responsibility to follow the transfer policy set by the creator of the T is on the buyer. Marketplaces: marketplaces can either watch for the offers made in personal Kiosks or even integrate the Kiosk primitive and build on top of it. In the custom logic scenario, the TransferPolicyCap can also be used to implement application-specific transfer rules.

By default gives the functionality to list an item openly - for anyone to purchase providing the guarantees for creators that every transfer needs to be approved via the TransferPolicy. struct\sKiosk\shas\sstore,\skey\n Fields id:\sobject::UID profits:\sbalance::Balance<sui::SUI> Balance of the Kiosk - all profits from sales go here. owner:\saddress Always point to sender of the transaction. Can be changed by calling set_owner with Cap. item_count:\su32 Number of items stored in a Kiosk. Used to allow unpacking an empty Kiosk if it was wrapped or has a single owner. allow_extensions:\sbool Whether to open the UID to public. Set to true by default but the owner can switch the state if necessary. Resource KioskOwnerCap A Capability granting the bearer a right to place and take items from the Kiosk as well as to list them and list_with_purchase_cap. struct\sKioskOwnerCap\shas\sstore,\skey\n Fields id:\sobject::UID for:\sobject::ID Resource PurchaseCap A capability which locks an item and gives a permission to purchase it from a Kiosk for any price no less than min_price. Allows exclusive listing: only bearer of the PurchaseCap can purchase the asset. However, the capablity should be used carefully as losing it would lock the asset in the Kiosk. The main application for the PurchaseCap is building extensions on top of the Kiosk. struct\sPurchaseCap<T:\sstore,\skey>\shas\sstore,\skey\n Fields id:\sobject::UID kiosk_id:\sobject::ID ID of the Kiosk the cap belongs to. item_id:\sobject::ID ID of the listed item. min_price:\su64 Minimum price for which the item can be purchased. Struct Borrow Hot potato to ensure an item was returned after being taken using the borrow_val call. struct\sBorrow\n Fields kiosk_id:\sobject::ID item_id:\sobject::ID Struct Item Dynamic field key for an item placed into the kiosk. struct\sItem\shas\scopy,\sdrop,\sstore\n Fields id:\sobject::ID Struct Listing Dynamic field key for an active offer to purchase the T.

Additional Resources Light (default) Rust Coal Navy Ayu Sui Move by Example Object Display A creator or a builder who owns a Publisher object can use the sui::display module to define display properties for their objects. To get a Publisher object check out the Publisher page. Display<T> is an object that specifies a set of named templates for the type T (for example, for a type 0x2::capy::Capy the display would be Display<0x2::capy::Capy>). All objects of the type T will be processed in the Sui Full Node RPC through the matching Display definition and will have processed result attached when an object is queried. Description Sui Object Display is a template engine which allows for on-chain display configuration for type to be handled off-chain by the ecosystem. It has the ability to use an object's data for substitution into a template string. There's no limitation to what fields can be set, all object properties can be accessed via the {property} syntax and inserted as a part of the template string (see examples for the illustration). Example For the following Hero module, the Display would vary based on the "name", "id" and "image_url" properties of the type "Hero". The template defined in the init function can be represented as: {\n\s\s\s\s"name":\s"{name}",\n\s\s\s\s"link":\s"https://sui-heroes.io/hero/{id}",\n\s\s\s\s"image_url":\s"ipfs://{img_url}",\n\s\s\s\s"description":\s"A\strue\sHero\sof\sthe\sSui\secosystem!",\n\s\s\s\s"project_url":\s"https://sui-heroes.io",\n\s\s\s\s"creator":\s"Unknown\sSui\sFan"\n}\n

Announcing Permanent Testnet The Sui Blog Sui Foundation Home About Contribute an Article Sui Ecosystem Announcing Permanent Testnet Sui Foundation Mar 29, 2023 4 min This new instance of the Sui network serves as Sui’s long-running, decentralized, and permissionless Testnet. Sui’s highly anticipated Permanent Testnet has finally arrived!! This instance of the Sui network serves as Sui’s long-running, decentralized, and permissionless Testnet. Unlike past Testnet Waves 1 and 2, this new Testnet will continue running even after Mainnet launch.With this network we bring a number of significant feature updates to the community.Core NetworkDynamic validator set: Validator candidates that meet sufficient stake requirements can join the network at epoch boundaries, and active validators can leave the network at epoch boundaries. This validator access model proves what it means to be permissionless.Protocol software and Sui framework upgrade support: Unlike Devnet, Testnet will not be wiped on each software update (unless there are extenuating circumstances). The community will be notified appropriately ahead of any planned software updates or data wipes on Testnet.Full node restore from database snapshot: Instead of waiting for a Full node to sync, node operators can leverage a checkpoint to quickly bring up a Full node.Addresses and signature updates: Account addresses, object IDs, and transaction IDs have been upgraded from 20 bytes to 32 bytes to prevent hash collisions. Additionally, Sui’s default hash function is now Blake2b rather than SHA3, as it is far more performant. And in order to support a wide range of transaction sizes, signatures are now applied over hash digests instead of serialized BCS data. This enables Sui compatibility with hardware wallets, whose signer APIs typically allow limited size inputs.Developer ExperienceIn keeping with our aspirations for Sui to be a best-in-breed developer platform, we view this milestone as the earliest incarnation of what we call Sui DevX 1.0, where a number of core developer primitives and semantics are brought together:the culmination of developer and builder feedback throughout the Sui journey thus farfoundation elements upon which Sui’s developer ergonomics and developer efficiency will continue to be refineddesigned with intent to enable a Sui ecosystem that is decentralized but not fragmentedThese primitives are:Programmable Transaction Blocks: This powerful construct enables chaining together a series of transactions–splitCoin, mergeCoins, transferObjects, moveCall, makeMoveVec, publish–to create a custom, atomic transaction block uniquely suited to your application needs. Since moveCall can specify any existing on-chain functionality, Programmable Transaction Blocks essentially provide ad-hoc transaction composition, significantly enhancing the versatility of the Sui Move programming model. Programmable Transaction Blocks also simplify gas coin management, as an application can pass in a vector of gas coin objects and perform coin split/merge within a Programmable Transaction Block, rather than having to perform coin selection before submission.Sponsored Transactions and gas station: While support for sponsored transactions has been in place since release 0.27, we are pleased to announce Shinami’s gas station (guide, API), which is now available for use with Sui’s Permanent Testnet!Object Display Standard: This standardizes off-chain display of objects of the same type using a set of named templates. Sui Explorer and Sui Wallet both support the Object Display Standard now. Sui APIs and Typescript/Rust SDKs also support the Object Display Standard. This was a collaborative effort with lots of ideas and brainstorming from the Sui Community–we would especially like to thank Capsules and OriginByte and for their input to this standard.Kiosk Standard: Kiosk, a powerful new primitive, supports listing an object for sale and enforcing creator-defined royalty policies when the object is sold. The combination of Object Display and Kiosk fill two key gaps for folks building collectibles and trading platforms on Sui. We encourage ecosystem wallets, explorers, and marketplaces to explore both the Object Display Standard and the Kiosk Standard for seamless compatibility across the ecosystem.RPC Revamp: There are now more aggregation-based RPC get* methods: getEpoch, getNetworkMetrics, getMoveCallMetrics, queryObjects. JSON RPC batched requests were deprecated in favor of MultiGet* methods. System events were deprecated in favor of dedicated fields in the transaction response. And lastly, a number of legacy RPC methods (marked with unsafe_*) were deprecated in favor of Programmable Transaction Blocks.Zero Knowledge Proofs: There is now Move API support for verifying Groth16 ZKP using both BN254 elliptic curve and BLS12-381 (two of the most widely-used curves). This provides for computation proofs in Sui smart contracts and enables privacy-preserving applications.Two Granularity of Timestamps: A fine-grained Clock module that supports 2-3 second granularity for near real-time applications, and a coarse-grained Epoch Timestamps.Move Package Upgrade: This is an essential functionality for developers to update their Move contract and to pull in upgrades of dependent packages. Move Package Upgrade will be available on Testnet with the next software update (tentatively planned for first week of April)! Stay tuned!In addition to using Devnet and Testnet, we also encourage builders to use the local environment for initial development and faster iterations. The sui-test-validator binary has been improved to aid with local development flow.Sui Devnet versus TestnetThe following table describes the differing network characteristics between Devnet and the Permanent Testnet as of the date of this publication.AttributeDevnetPermanent Testnet Validator setFour Mysten Labs-operated validators93 validators + 2 Mysten Labs-operated validatorsFull nodeMysten Labs-operated plus community operated nodesMysten Labs-operated plus community operated nodesValidator locationUS-EastGeo-distributedDurationPermanentPermanent AccessPublicPublicJSON API URLhttps://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443Discord Faucet Discord channelDiscord channelFaucet Unit1 SUI per request1 SUI per requestEpoch Duration24 hours24 hoursReference Gas Price1 MISTStarting epoch 0 at 1,000 MIST.

Incident SupportMysten Labs oncalls and Mysten Labs incident management protocolMysten Labs oncalls plus necessary coordination with validatorsJoin the ActionAs you can see, there are many powerful and new capabilities that are now possible on a decentralized and permissionless network. If you are an interested validator or full node operator, we welcome you to join the network. If you are an app builder, we would love to see your creativity on Sui DevX 1.0 (especially for Programmable Transaction Blocks and Sponsored Transactions)!Thank you for being part of the Sui community, we highly appreciate each of your unique contributions towards shaping the soon-to-be Sui Mainnet!

In Sui, you write Smart Contracts with the Sui Move Programming language. This page links to key Move resources and compares the Move and Solidity programming languages. For a full description of the issues with traditional smart contract languages, see the Move Problem Statement. Sui Move First, note Move is based upon the well-supported Rust programming language. And Sui Move differs from core Move in subtle yet distinct ways. Here are resources to ramp up on Sui Move: Sui Move announcement Sui source code rustdoc output Sui Move by Example Move resources This section aggregates links to external resources on the Move programming language. See also our Smart Contracts with Move page and Move Programming with Objects tutorial series for key Move resources in this site. Move & Sui podcast on Zero Knowledge where programmable objects are described in detail. Original Move Book written by a member of the Sui team. Core Move documentation, including: Tutorial - A step-by-step guide through writing a Move module. Book - A summary with pages on various topics. Examples - A set of samples, such as for defining a coin and swapping it. Awesome Move - A summary of resources related to Move, from blockchains through code samples. Move vs. Solidity Currently, the main player on the blockchain languages scene is Solidity. As one of the first blockchain languages, Solidity was designed to implement basic programming language concepts using well known data types (e.g. byte array, string) and data structures (such as hashmaps) with the ability to build custom abstractions using a well-known base. However, as blockchain technology developed it became clear that the main purpose of blockchain languages is operating on digital assets, and the main quality of such languages is security and verifiability (which is an additional layer of security). Move was specifically designed to address both problems: representation of digital assets and safe operations over them. To provide additional protection, it has been co-developed along with the Move Prover verification tool. This allows Move developers to write formal specifications for the key correctness properties of their application, then use the prover to check that these properties will hold for all possible transactions and inputs. One fundamental difference between the EVM and Move is the data model for assets: EVM assets are encoded as entries in owner_address\s->\s<bytes\sencoding\sasset> hash maps. Asset updates and transfers work by updating entries in this map. There is no type or value representing an asset, and thus an asset cannot be passed as an argument, returned from a function, or be stored inside of another asset. Only unstructured bytes can be passed across contract boundaries, and thus each asset is forever trapped inside the contract that defines it. Move assets are arbitrary user-defined types. Assets can be passed as arguments, returned from functions, and stored inside other assets. In addition, assets can flow freely across contract boundaries without losing their integrity thanks to Move's built-in resource safety 1 2 protections. Sui heavily leverages the Move data model for performance. Sui's persistent state is a set of programmable Move objects that can be updated, created, and destroyed by transactions. Each object has ownership metadata that allows Sui validators to both execute and commit transactions using the object in parallel with causally unrelated transactions. Move's type system ensures the integrity of this ownership metadata across executions. The result is a system where developers write ordinary Move smart contracts, but validators leverage the data model to execute and commit transactions as efficiently as possible. This is simply not possible with the EVM data model. Because assets are stored in dynamically indexable maps, a validator would be unable to determine when transactions might touch the same asset. Sui's parallel execution and commitment scheme needs a language like Move with the vocabulary to describe structured assets that can flow freely across contracts. To be blunt: even if we preferred the EVM/Solidity to Move, we could not use them in Sui without sacrificing the performance breakthroughs that make Sui unique. One of the main advantages of Move is data composability. It is always possible to create a new struct (asset) Y that will hold initial asset X in it. Even more - with addition of generics, it is possible to define generic wrapper Z(T) that will be able to wrap any asset, providing additional properties to a wrapped asset or combining it with others. See how composability works in our Sandwich example.

GPG key ID: 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 Learn about vigilant mode. Highlights [Major breaking change] - SuiAddress and ObjectID are now 32 bytes long instead of 20 bytes (in hex, the len increases from 40 to 64). If your software interacts with any ObjectID and SuiAddress, you must update it to use updated addresses and redeploy it. (#8542) [Major breaking change] - Modules sui::digest, sui::safe, sui::typed_id, sui::immutable_external_resource, sui::locked_coin, sui::epoch_time_lock [Breaking change] - entry function sui::coin::burn_ removed (sui::coin::burn is now entry) [Major breaking change] - SuiAddress is now calculated as the first 32 bytes of the Blake2b hash of flag\s||\spubkey instead of the SHA3_256 hash. (#9262) Move smart contracts can now access the blockchain timestamp. To access the timestamp, your smart contract should read a shared object, Clock, at the address 0x6 and use Clock::timestamp_ms(&Clock) to read the timestamp. You should always reference the Clock object with ObjectArg::SharedObject::mutable set to false. See usage in https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/in-progress/time.md Move smart contracts can now also access the coarse epoch start timestamp (updated every 24 hours) without referencing the Clock object. To do so, call TxContext::epoch_timestamp. The current epoch number is also available via TxContext::epoch. This release integrates the Sui Object Display into Sui Full node. The new Object Query API supports the Sui Object Display Standard. The main document explaining the feature and the reasons behind it is here: https://forums.sui.io/t/nft-object-display-proposal-accepted/4872 and the examples of Display use are now located in the Sui by Example book: https://examples.sui.io/basics/display.html. Effective with this release, Sui Explorer and Sui Wallet support the Sui Object Display Standard. NFTs that use a previous implementation might not render as expected. [Minor breaking change] - Removed bulletproofs and elliptic_curve from the Sui Framework. https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/8660/files [Breaking change] - ecdsa_k1::ecrecover and ecdsa_k1::secp256k1_verify now require you to input the raw message instead of a hashed message. You must also include the u8 that represents the hash function. See #7773) for more details. Adds an RPC method routing for backward compatibility support #8334 [API breaking change] - This release replaces SuiCertifiedTransaction with SuiTransaction in SuiTransactionResponse. This is because validators can no longer guarantee to return a transaction certificate. This release also unifies SuiTransactionResponse and SuiExecuteTransactionResponse to simplify the API. See #8369 for more information. [API breaking change] - Updated the structure for dynamic field names to make it easier to use in sui_getDynamicFieldObject. For more details, see #7318 [Transaction Format breaking change] - Added a new expiration field to TransactionData to allow for users to specify a time that a transaction should expire, meaning it is no longer eligible to sign and execute by validators. In this release, the only supported value for the expiration\sfield\sis\sepoch`. If not provided, no expiration is set for the associated transaction. [API breaking change] - This release removes the request_switch_delegation function from the Transaction Builder API. It also removes the pending_delegation_switches field from the validator set type in the Sui SDK. #8435 [Minor breaking change] - This release modifies the format for ConsensusCommitPrologue transactions. This is a system-generated transaction that updates timestamp on the Clock object, allowing Sui Move smart contracts to read up-to-date timestamps from the blockchain. [Major breaking change] - This release replaces the sui_getValidators and sui_getSuiSystemState functions with a new sui_getLatestSuiSystemState function. The new function returns a flattened type that contains all information from the latest SuiSystemState object on-chain with type SuiSystemStateSummary. It also contains a vector of type SuiValidatorSummary that summarizes information from each validator, including: metadata, staking pool, and other data. The release also adds a p2p_address to each validator’s metadata. The value for the field is the address the validator used for p2p activities, such as state sync. [API breaking change] As part of the effort to reduce the size of Sui Full node synchronization payload, this release removes events from TransactionEffect. The events are still included in the SuiTransactionResponse returned by sui_getTransaction and sui_submitTransaction endpoints. #7822 [Major breaking change] - Programmable Transaction Blocks is a new construct that replaces both batch transactions and normal transactions (with the exception of special system transactions). Programmable Transaction blocks allow for a series of transactions to be chained and executed atomically, where the results of one transaction can be used as input for the following transactions. For more information, see [Programmable Transaction blocks with the TS SDK](https://docs.sui.io/build/prog-trans-ts-sdk). [Breaking change] - Changes to Gas Budget to use SUI rather than gas units. This removes the concept of gas units from any user-related API operations. This does not change the format of TransactionData (u64). This is not a breaking change in the sense that the current format no longer works, but rather requires you to reconsider how you use gas budgets. [Breaking change] - Changes to gas metering logic within the VM. This removes the per-bytecode costs, and instead replaces it with a tiered costing schedule based on the number of instructions executed, bytes allocated on the stack, and maximal stack height. Metering for native functions is defined as before on a per-native basis. This is not a breaking change in the sense that current format will no longer work, but may require you to reconsider your gas budgets for certain transactions. [Breaking change] - Currently, transactions require a single coin to pay for gas. This sometimes results in users needing to make separate transactions (such as PaySui) to merge coins before completing a transaction, which can also increase the cost of the transaction. This release changes the field in TransactionData from gas_payment:\sObjectRef to gas_payment:\sVec<ObjectRef>, where ObjectRef is a non-empty vector of owned SUI objects. This combines all of the coins into a single coin, using the ObjectID of the first coin in the vector. [API breaking change] - The StakedSui object now includes the ID of the staking pool, pool_id. ****For more information, see #8371 [Major breaking change] The sui_getObject endpoint now takes an additional configuration parameter of type SuiObjectDataOptions to control which fields the endpoint retrieves. By default, the endpoint retrieves only object references unless the client request explicitly specifies other data, such as type, owner, or bcs. To learn more, see (#8817) [Major API breaking change] The previous sui_getObjectsOwnedByAddress has been renamed to sui_getOwnedObjects. In addition the response has been standardized across the object related APIs to return SuiObjectResponse which has changed from its original implementation to instead have a data field and an error field. To learn more see #9668. [Major breaking change] - The ID leak verifier that governs usage of UIDs in Sui Move code has been rewritten and flipped. New objects must now get “fresh” UIDs created in the function where the object is made, but when the object’s struct destroyed, the UID can be stored as if the object was wrapped (but without it's contents). In contrast, the previous rules stated that the UID could come from anywhere, but must have been destroyed when the object was unpacked. We have made this change to make using dynamic fields a bit more ergonomic, so you do not always need a Bag or Table if you want to retain access to dynamic fields after unpacking an object into its constituent fields. See #8026 for details and a migration example. [Major breaking change] - This release changes the serialization format of Sui object types. Sui now uses a more compact serialization format for common types such as Coin, Coin, and StakedSui, reducing object size by up to 40%. This lowers storage gas costs for objects of these types. This doesn’t effect clients using JSON-RPC API read functions, but clients that read raw Sui objects directly need to understand the new type encoding. Note that the encoding of Sui Move structs remains unchanged. See #9055 for more details. [Major API breaking changes] - GetTransaction API refactoring [RPC] sui_getTransaction and sui_multiGetTransaction now take in an additional optional parameter called options that specifies which fields to retrieve (such as transaction, effects, events, etc). By default, these operations return only the transaction digest. [TS SDK] Renamed provider.getTransactionWithEffects to provider.getTransactionResponse. The new method takes in an additional parameter, SuiTransactionResponseOptions, to configure which fields to retrieve (such as transaction, effects, events, etc). By default, this method returns only the transaction digest. For more information, see #8888. [Major API breaking changes] sui_executeTransaction refactoring Removed sui_executeTransactionSerializedSig and sui_submitTransaction operations. The sui_executeTransaction operation now takes a vector of signatures instead of a single signature to support Sponsored Transactions. To learn more, see #9068. [Minor breaking change] - Removed Randomness from the Sui Framework and the sui_tblsSignRandomnessObject JSON RPC. #8977 [RPC API breaking change] - Various changes in JSON-RPC governance API updated sui_getDelegatedStakes to the new staking flow grouped all StakedSui by staking pool to reduce duplicate validator info in the response improve ValidatorMetadata json response to make it more human readable, which affects getSuiSystemState as well. make SuiSystemState json response camelCased added --epoch-duration-ms option to sui\sgenesis for configuring localnet epoch duration For more information, see #8848 [Minor breaking change] - This changes genesis snapshot since the generation for a PoP changed. It also removes Move APIs bls12381::bls12381_min_sig_verify_with_domain, validator::verify_proof_of_possession because now all validate PoP is now done in validator::validate_metadata New validator committee and metadata management functionalities are introduced, including entry functions for signing up as a validator candidate, and for rotating the various metadata of validators. Also staking support is added for validator candidates and inactive validators. For more information, see #8839, #8768 and #8708. [API breaking change] - This release removes locked coin staking functionality, and changes the layout of the StakedSui object to remove the locking period field. For more information, see #9046. [API breaking change] Delegation functions have all been renamed to use the word “stake” instead. See #9059. [Breaking change] - This release introduces several limits on transactions and transaction executions. Many of these limits are subject to change prior to Sui Mainnet. To view a list of limits in release .28, see the source code. The Groth16 ZKP verifier in Move is updated such that it now allows verification of proofs created over the BN254 elliptic curve construction. The API for the existing Groth16 verifier over BLS12-381 has changed. See #9196. [API breaking change] A valid signature must be committed to the Blake2b hash of the message before passing to any signing APIs. If a signature is created elsewhere, please ensure the transaction data is hashed first. See #9561 [Breaking change] sui-framework Move package has been separated into two packages: sui-framework and sui-system. sui-system contains modules that were previously in the governance folder and sui-framework contains everything else. The path of the packages within the sui repo have changed as well. See #9618 [Breaking change] validator_address field has been removed from StakedSui objects. This way pool_id becomes the only unique identifier for a staking pool. [Major Breaking Change] The sui::transfer functions of transfer, share_object, and freeze_object have been split into public and private variants. In the past, Sui had a custom verifier rule that ensured a transferred object was either defined in the current module or the object had the store type ability. This behavior was a bit hidden and not amenable to future Move type system improvements. To make the behavior more explicit, the normal functions transfer, share_object, and freeze_object can now only be used in the object’s module. To use sui::transfer functions outside of the object’s module, you must use the new public_ variants, i.e. public_transfer, public_share_object, and public_freeze_object. To migrate, use sui::transfer::public_* when interacting with objects outside of their module. And when inside their module, use the non-public_ variants.

GPG key ID: 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 Learn about vigilant mode. Highlights Sui now accepts weighted multi-scheme Multisig signatures. [enum GenericSignature] replaces all [enum Signature] for user signature verification logic. The [Sui Keytool](https://docs.sui.io/devnet/build/json-rpc#sign-a-transaction-using-the-sui-keytool) command supports 1) Generating Multisig addresses 2) Combining a single signature into a Multisig. Design: #7187 PR: #7110 [Sponsored Transaction](#8273) Breaking Change - You can now use a different account than the account used for a transaction to pay gas fees for a transaction. TransactionData now contains GasData to consolidate gas-related info, including gas_owner. When gas_owner is different from the transaction sender, the transaction is a Sponsored Transaction. SenderSignedData now contains a list of user signatures. A Sponsored transaction must include both the sender’s and the sponsor’s signatures. Duplicated or third-party signatures are not valid. The order of signatures does not matter. No Sui transactions, such as PaySui, PayAllSui, TransferSui can be sponsored transactions because they involve transferring the gas object. The Transaction execution APIs now take a list of signatures. RPC Data Structure changes TransactionEffects now contain an executed_epoch field that indicates which epoch this transaction was executed in. TransactionEffects now contain an unwrapped_then_deleted field that contains ObjectRefs that are deleted from the wrapped state. These objects are no longer accounted for within the deleted field. TransactionResponse , the response when you call the get_transaction RPC interface, now contains a checkpoint field that indicates which checkpoint includes the transaction. Bugfix for Source Verification on Publish which was incorrectly suggested that dependencies on-chain differed from dependencies built from source (move-language/move#904) Full Changelog: https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/commits/devnet-0.27.0 Assets 7 All reactions Footer © 2023 GitHub, Inc.

Request types: 1. WaitForEffectsCert: waits for TransactionEffectsCert and then return to client. This mode is a proxy for transaction finality. 2. WaitForLocalExecution: waits for TransactionEffectsCert and make sure the node executed the transaction locally before returning the client. The local execution makes sure this node is aware of this transaction when client fires subsequent queries. However if the node fails to execute the transaction locally in a timely manner, a bool type in the response is set to false to indicated the case. request_type is default to be `WaitForEffectsCert` unless options.show_events or options.show_effects is true Params tx_bytes : <Base64> - BCS serialized transaction data bytes without its type tag, as base-64 encoded string.signatures : <[Base64]> - A list of signatures (`flag || signature || pubkey` bytes, as base-64 encoded string).
